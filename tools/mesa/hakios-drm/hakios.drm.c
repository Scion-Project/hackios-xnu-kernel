/*
 * The libdrm of xf86drm.h (see there): Linux's DRM requests to the kernel's GPU driver as calls
 * of its IOKit user client. A request's number (the low byte of the ioctl code) is the call's
 * selector, its structure goes in and comes back as it is; a buffer's memory is the client
 * memory of the type that is the buffer's handle.
 *
 * Two of the kernel's services speak so, one for each GPU; a phone has one of them:
 *   HakiosGPU    the POCO X5 Pro's Adreno, as Linux's msm driver, for Mesa's freedreno
 *                (drivers/gpu/hakios.gpu.cpp)
 *   HakiosMali   the Galaxy S9's Mali-G72, as Linux's panfrost driver, for Mesa's panfrost
 *                (drivers/gpu/hakios.mali.cpp)
 * drmOpenWithType() opens the one asked for by the name of its Linux driver, and drmGetVersion()
 * answers with that name: it is what Mesa's panfrost picks its backend by (pan_kmod.c). Every
 * request of freedreno's goes to the kernel as it is. Of panfrost's, two are seen to here first,
 * because HakiosMali does not do them as Linux's driver does (submit(), wait_buffer()), and its
 * fences are made here, of the kernel's job numbers (the sync objects at the end).
 *
 * The driver knows its device by a file descriptor. It gets one that means nothing (/dev/null):
 * there is one GPU and one connection to it in a process.
