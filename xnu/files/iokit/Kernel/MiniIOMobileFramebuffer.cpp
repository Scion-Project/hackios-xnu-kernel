 * The display user space is told about. The system carries the identity of the iPhone X
 * (see the loader), and Darwin draws whatever size of screen IOMobileFramebuffer reports: UIKit and
 * SpringBoard lay themselves out in points, as wide and as tall as the display is. What is fixed is
 * the status bar: UIKit picks it by the screen's exact geometry, and has one for a phone with the
 * iPhone X's sensor housing only at Apple's widths (_UIStatusBarVisualProvider_Split1125, 1080, 1170,
 * 1242, 828, 1284); at any other it draws a red bar saying "rdar://45025538" ("No status bar visual
 * provider for screen ..."). UIKit takes the one named by UIStatusBarVisualProviderClassName in the
 * defaults instead, which user space sets from the display's width (userland's libhakios.sb).
 * MobileGestalt's main-screen-class is -1 for any size not Apple's (MGIOMFBSupport.c: "screen
 * parameters are unexpected"), and MobileGestalt answers from its cache on /var, made at an earlier
 * boot, until that is made again: main-screen-width and -height can be an earlier size's.
 *
 * So by default (fb_native=1), on a panel wider than 1125 pixels whose shape is not the iPhone's,
 * the display is 375 points wide, the iPhone's own width, and as many points tall as the panel's
 * shape makes, at 3 pixels a point. On the Galaxy S9's 1440 x 2960 (18.5:9; the S9+'s and the Note9's
 * are the same) that is 375 x 771 points, 1125 x 2313 pixels, enlarged by the DPU (fb_dpp) 1.28 times
 * across and 1.2797 down: 0.02 % apart, nothing visibly squeezed and no black bars. The iPhone's own
 * 1125 x 2436 (19.5:9) on that panel was stretched 1.28 across and 1.215 down.
 * Why not fewer points: at 360 x 740 points (1080 x 2220, the panel's FHD+ and exactly its shape) the
 * keyboard is cut off on the right, "p", backspace and "search" with it (the S9, 3 November). The
 * width of 375 points is one the keyboard is whole at.
 * In QEMU (the loader makes the panel 1125 x 2436) and on panels 1125 pixels wide or less the display
 * stays the iPhone's 1125 x 2436 (untried there; fbwidth= and fbheight= give any size).
 * Boot-args fbwidth= and fbheight= give the size outright (the iPhone's for the one not given).
 * Boot-arg fb_native=0: the iPhone's 1125 x 2436 on every panel, as before (the picture stretched to the panel's shape).

 * Switch Metal's own device discovery on, from user space: IORegistryEntrySetCFProperties() with
 * MetalPluginName and MetalPluginClassName. Metal reads the first (getMetalPluginClassForService,
 * 0x181a39ba4), builds "/System/Library/Extensions/" + it + ".bundle", opens that with NSBundle
 * and takes the class the second names; with the first missing it returns nil before it even
 * reads the second, and that single `cbz` is where the chain breaks on this port today.
 *
 * This method is the only thing that was in the way. IORegistryEntry::setProperties is
 * "return kIOReturnUnsupported" (IORegistryEntry.cpp) and IOService does not override it; the
 * MAC check in front of the call has no policy to ask, because this kernel registers no iokit
 * hook (bsd/kern/kern_minimac.c); and this service carries no property whitelist.
 *
 * Why it is gated on a boot-arg, which is a measured risk and not caution in general
 * (docs/metal.md 10.14): the conditions Metal puts on a device object are asserts, not soft
 * refusals (10.2-10.3). A process that asks Metal and is handed a half-made device does not
 * degrade to another renderer -- it aborts ("Assertion failed: ([self
 * conformsToProtocol:@protocol(MTLDeviceSPI)])", "failed assertion _limits.maxColorAttachments
 * > 0"), and an aborting daemon is restarted by launchd, which is a loop. Published instead at
 * registerService() time, the properties would exist before launchd, backboardd and SpringBoard
 * are born, so each of the three would take the Metal road on its first call, with nobody left
 * to read the log. Behind a boot-arg, a machine that has them is a machine booted on purpose to
 * have them, and the first such boot is meant to be RC=rc.darwin, where launchd is never born.
 *
 * An empty string removes a property rather than setting it. That is the way out of the loop
 * above without a reboot: the properties live only in the registry, so processes started after
 * they are gone go back to the software road.
 *
 * Everything else is refused, and refused whole, before anything is set: every process on the
 * machine can reach this method and the only thing it exists for is this one switch.
