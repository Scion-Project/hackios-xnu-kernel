/*
 * Darwin-on-hakios: the Galaxy S9's PCIe root complex of channel 0 (drivers/wifi/hakios.exynos_pcie.c), as the radio's
 * driver behind it sees it (drivers/wifi/hakios.brcmfmac.c, which gives it to Linux's brcmfmac as a struct pci_dev).
 *
 * There is one endpoint, 1:00.0, the BCM4361. Stage 1 (wifi_pcie=1..5) brings the link up and places the endpoint's
 * BARs; wifi_pcie=6 then turns its memory decoding on and hands it over: hakios_brcmfmac_start() is called on the
 * stage's own thread, and what is below may be used from then on, from any thread (one at a time: the radio's
 * driver has one caller). Before that, or when stage 1 stopped short, hakios_exynos_pcie_ready() is false and the
 * rest answers nothing (all ones, as a bus with nothing on it).
