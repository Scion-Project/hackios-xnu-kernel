/*
 * SCGPU: the GPU of the Scion app, for an XNU guest under the Android Virtualization Framework.
 *
 * crosvm's virtio-gpu draws with the phone's GPU through gfxstream, but it can't show a picture to
 * a sideloaded app (avf/DISPLAY.md), so every frame had to come back into guest memory and go out
 * again through the shared framebuffer (SCFB): a readback of the GPU's picture for every frame, then
 * two copies. Here the app runs gfxstream's host renderer itself (tools/gfxstream/mk-host-android.sh)
 * and presents the guest's colour buffers straight into its window: nothing comes back.
 *
 * The guest still speaks virtio-gpu to it -- the same commands /dev/vgpu3d sends to crosvm
 * (bsd/dev/hakios.vgpu3d.c), the same gfxstream pipe on top -- but through a region of guest RAM the
 * app lends and maps too, as SCFB and SCCAM are lent (a CustomMemoryBackingFile). The kernel learns
 * where from scgpu.addr= and scgpu.size=; avfboot keeps the region out of XNU's memory.
 *
 *   +0           struct scgpu_header (one page)
 *   +4 KiB       the command: one virtio-gpu control command, as it would go on the control queue
 *   +64 KiB      its reply
 *   +128 KiB...  the pool: memory the guest hands out and names by guest physical address, as it would
 *                to a virtio device (ATTACH_BACKING of the pipe buffers, SCGPU_CMD_TRANSFER's staging);
 *                the app reaches it at the same offset in its own mapping
 *
 * One command at a time, as on a control queue: the guest writes the command and req_len, then bumps
 * req_seq (a release); the app sees it (an acquire), runs it, writes the reply, resp_len and status,
 * then sets resp_seq = req_seq (a release).
 *
 * Waiting: each side spins a little, then sleeps on a doorbell -- a virtio-input device named
 * "scion-scgpu" (SCGPU_BELL_NAME) whose socket is the app's. The guest rings by putting an event on
 * its status queue (crosvm writes it into the socket), the app by writing one into the socket (crosvm
 * puts it on the event queue: an interrupt). A side rings only when the other has said it sleeps
 * (host_sleeping, guest_waiting), and says so before its last look at the sequence it waits for, with
 * a full barrier on both sides, so one of the two always sees the other. Without the device (an older
 * app) both sides poll as before.
 *
 * The stream ring: what user space writes to the pipe (the GL stream, write(2) on /dev/vgpu3d) does
 * not go through the mailbox, one command per write and a wait for each, but into a byte ring in the
 * pool (ring_off, ring_size, a power of two) as records -- struct scgpu_record, then the bytes, then
 * padding to 16 -- and the guest goes on at once. ring_head (the guest's) and ring_tail (the app's) count
 * bytes forever; their difference is what waits. The app hands each record to its resource (the
 * context's pipe) and moves ring_tail on, and it does so with everything the ring holds before it runs
 * any mailbox command: so a reply, an upload or a read still comes after every byte written before it.
 * The guest waits only for room (and rings the app, or is rung, as for the mailbox).
 *
 * With SCGPU_F_RING_CMDS from the app, a record of kind SCGPU_REC_CMD holds a virtio-gpu command
 * instead of stream bytes, one whose reply nothing waits for: RESOURCE_CREATE_3D,
 * RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING, CTX_ATTACH_RESOURCE, CTX_DETACH_RESOURCE, RESOURCE_UNREF. The app runs it
 * where it is in the ring, in order with the stream around it, and only logs a failure. A colour
 * buffer then costs the guest no round trip to make or let go (it was five, each a wait for the app).
 *
 * Commands are virtio-gpu's (virtio 1.2, 5.7.6), with these meanings at the app:
 *   GET_CAPSET_INFO, GET_CAPSET            gfxstream's capsets (stream_renderer_get_cap_set/fill_caps)
 *   CTX_CREATE, CTX_DESTROY                stream_renderer_context_create/destroy
 *   RESOURCE_CREATE_3D, RESOURCE_UNREF     stream_renderer_resource_create/unref
 *   RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING                the entries are in the pool (none: no backing)
 *   CTX_ATTACH_RESOURCE, CTX_DETACH_RESOURCE
 *   TRANSFER_TO_HOST_3D, TRANSFER_FROM_HOST_3D   on the attached backing (the pipe)
 *   RESOURCE_FLUSH                         present the resource (a colour buffer) in the app's window:
 *                                          stream_renderer_flush; SET_SCANOUT is not needed
 * and one of its own:
 *   SCGPU_CMD_TRANSFER                     a transfer through a staging buffer in the pool instead of
 *                                          a backing attached for good, so that the hundreds of
 *                                          colour buffers CoreAnimation shares cost no guest memory
