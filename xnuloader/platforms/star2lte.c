/*
 * The Galaxy S9+ (SM-G965F, star2lte) and the Galaxy Note9 (SM-N960F, crownlte): the S9's SoC, board and memory map. Every
 * address above is the same in their device trees (Samsung's BSP, exynos9810-star2lte_eur_open_26.dts and
 * exynos9810-crownlte_eur_open_26.dts: the GIC, the timer, the PMU, both cluster watchdogs, reserved-memory's modem_if,
 * cp_ram_logging, abox_rmem, exynos_ss and log_pstore, secure_camera), and the panel is 1440 x 2960 on all three, its buffer
 * at 0xCC000000 (the S9+'s seen there by the WoA port for it, ntdevlabs/exynos9810-woa; the Note9's not seen by anyone).
 * Their RAM (6 GB; the Note9 6 or 8 GB) is UEFI's to report: Silicium's RamManagerLib reads its size from what S-Boot
 * left at NS_IRAM + 0x848, and the kernel's window is the largest free block, at most MAX_MEM_SIZE. So only the name
 * differs, and with it what the drivers that look at /arm-io's device_type do (the MAX77705's battery). The framebuffer
 * cannot tell them from the S9: the device's own image says which it is (loader_platform=, devices/<name>/mkimage.sh),
 * and without that they run as the S9. Written, not seen: nobody has run this on an S9+ or a Note9.
