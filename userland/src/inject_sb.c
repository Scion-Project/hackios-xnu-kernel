/*
 * libhakios.sb.dylib: code of ours inside SpringBoard (see inject.c for how it gets there).
 *
 *   - The phone is "activated". SpringBoard asks mobileactivationd, which is not running (and
 *     could not talk to Apple anyway); without an answer it treats the device as bricked and
 *     shows the first-boot setup ("hello") instead of the lock screen.
 *   - The setup assistant is never needed, whatever the reason: nobody is going to go through
 *     it here.
 *   - SpringBoard starts a few seconds late where the kernel's boot-args say so (sb_delay=N;
 *     "xl run" does for the phone). /private/var is empty at every boot, so the applications
 *     are registered anew each time, one after another; one that is registered after
 *     SpringBoard has laid out the home screen ends up on a later page, and which one that is
 *     differs from boot to boot. On the phone that happens; under QEMU, where everything takes
 *     five times as long, it does not -- and there the delay is harmful: for a reason not yet
 *     found the window server then never takes our touch screen service for its own.
 *     (A wrapper program in the launchd job would be the obvious way to wait; launchd panics
 *     the system when a system job runs anything that is not Apple's.)
 *   - The picture SpringBoard keeps of an application that leaves the screen (for the application
 *     switcher and the next launch) is saved as JPEG or PNG, not as an ASTC texture: see
 *     snapshot_output_format().
 *   - Where CoreAnimation draws with its software renderer (QEMU; the phone without gpu=1) the
 *     "vibrant" views draw their content as it is: see plain_vibrancy().
 *   - A press of the side button that is long over is not taken for a long press (Siri) because
 *     SpringBoard was busy waking the display: see lock_long_press().
 *   - A long press on the lock screen's wallpaper does not open the poster switcher, which the
 *     window server here shows as a black screen: see poster_switcher_allowed().
 *   - With brightness_bridge=1 the brightness the user sets reaches the panel, which CoreBrightness
 *     alone never does here: see brightness_bridge().
 *   - Darwin notifications as a remote control, for scripts (rwtouch notify NAME):
 *       com.hakios.unlock      what the lock screen does after "swipe up to open"
 *       com.hakios.layers      write down the layers SpringBoard has on the screen: see layers()
 *       com.hakios.switcher    open the switcher of running applications: see switcher()
 *     In any other program given this library (INJECT in build.sh) only the last of them is
 *     answered, with that program's layers: its windows' and those of its CoreAnimation contexts
 *     that have no window (chronod's, where the home screen's widgets are drawn: rc.jobs.widgets).

 *                                                            loaded when Control Center is first opened)
 *   -[SBBrightnessController setBrightnessLevel:] and _setBrightnessLevel:showHUD:   SpringBoard's own
 *   -[BrightnessSystemClient setProperty:forKey:]           CoreBrightness, key DisplayBrightness
 *   BKSDisplayBrightnessSet(float, NSInteger)               BackBoardServices; its calls are rebound only in
 *                                                            the libraries outside the shared cache (inside it
 *                                                            one library branches straight into the other)
 * Each passes the level on and then does what it did. Control Center's slider would then jump
 * back to 0.5 when it is opened again (it asks -[... _backlightLevel], which asks
 * BKSDisplayBrightnessGetCurrent), so once the user has set a level, that is what it is told.
 * The old way stays beside them: the level is asked for four times a second --
 * BKSDisplayBrightnessGetCurrent() of BackBoardServices, or failing that CoreBrightness's own
 * BrightnessSystemClient (property DisplayBrightness) -- and taken when it changes (only then, so
 * a level that stays at 0.5 does not undo the user's).
 * A level goes to the panel driver's sysctl kern.hakios.brightness (0-255; the Galaxy S9's
 * hakios.s6e3ha8.c) on a square curve with a floor, so a slider at zero is dim and never black:
 *     level = 8 + 247 * b * b      (b = 0.0 ... 1.0)
 * brightness_bridge=2 also takes the panel to 0 (its lowest level, still lit) while SpringBoard
 * says the screen is blanked (notification state com.apple.springboard.hasBlankedScreen), and back
 * to the user's level as soon as it is not. Which hooks are in is said once; a hook's first call is
 * said, and a change of level at most once a second, with where it came from ("hakios:
 * brightness: ..."). Whatever is not found is said once and only that part is left out; nothing
 * here can stop SpringBoard.
