/*
 * A USB device ("gadget") link for phones with a DesignWare DWC3: the kernel's log streamed to a host over a CDC-ACM
 * serial port (Linux /dev/ttyACM0, macOS /dev/cu.usbmodem*, Windows COMn), and a small line console back. For a run that
 * has no serial port and gave back only what fits in pstore (32 KB on the Galaxy S9, read in TWRP), this is the whole
 * log, as it is written, for as long as the run lasts, and the panic text at the end.
 *
 * Device-neutral: the DWC3 in device mode, its event buffer, endpoint 0 and the bulk endpoints are here; the CDC-ACM
 * descriptors and requests are plain C in hakios.usb_acm.h (checked on the build machine: tools/usb-acm-test.sh); what
 * the SoC has to do first (clocks, power, the PHY) is a glue's (hakios.usb_glue.h), today only the Exynos 9810's
 * (hakios.exynos_usb.c, the Galaxy S9). Polled from a thread call, no interrupt; one control transfer at a time, one
 * TRB per transfer (LST set), each in its own cache line of memory mapped uncached.
 *
 * The tree had no USB device code of its own: the POCO's loader serves fastboot through Qualcomm's UEFI USB protocol
 * (xnuloader/loader.c, usb_start()), which the S9's Silicium UEFI does not have (no USB driver in its FD), and nothing
 * of it survives ExitBootServices-less hand-over into the kernel. So this is new, not a port of that.
 *
 * THE STEPS (usb_gadget=N does the first N; each says what it is about to do before it does it):
 *   1  look: the glue reads the SoC's side (PMU isolation, clocks, the PHY's registers, the supplies through ACPM) and,
 *      when the controller has a clock, the DWC3's: its ID (GSNPSID), GCTL, DCTL (RUN_STOP: did S-Boot leave it running?),
 *      DSTS, the event buffer it was given. Reads only.
 *   2  PHY: a controller left running is stopped first (DCTL RUN_STOP clear, DEVCTRLHLT awaited, its events masked),
 *      then the glue's PHY sequence (Exynos 9810: hakios.exynos_usb.c's head, every write read back).
 *   3  core: a device soft reset (DCTL CSFTRST, as dwc3_soft_reset()), whatever the boot left (see below); then the
 *      USB 2.0 PHY interface, GCTL in device mode, bus bursts, the event buffer in this kernel's memory, DCFG high speed,
 *      the device events, endpoint 0 (DEPSTARTCFG, a transfer resource each, DEPCFG) and the first SETUP TRB. The pull-up
 *      stays off: the host sees nothing.
 *   4  enumerate: DCTL RUN_STOP: the host sees a device and asks; endpoint 0 answers (USB 2.0 chapter 9 and CDC's
 *      requests), each request said in the log (the first 64, then every hundredth); SET_CONFIGURATION sets up the bulk
 *      endpoints, nothing is sent on them. The PHY's line state is said every 10 s until a host is seen.
 *   5  ACM: the kernel's log from its first line (the part the kernel keeps of it, then everything new) goes out on
 *      bulk IN, and lines typed on the host come in on bulk OUT to the line console below.
 *
 * Was the controller touched before? Not by UEFI: Silicium's starlte FD has no USB driver (hakios.exynos_usb.c says
 * where that is seen). S-Boot has a download mode and charger detection and may leave it in any state, so step 3
 * always resets it, and step 2 stops it first if it runs; step 1 says what was found. The reset is the one Linux does
 * on every start (dwc3_core_init: dwc3_soft_reset then dwc3_core_soft_reset, both DCTL CSFTRST).
 *
 * THE LINE CONSOLE (step 5). Lines typed on the host, ended by Enter; the device echoes the line ("usb> ...") and
 * answers. The answers and the echo go into the kernel's log (and so to the host); not to the screen.
 *   help              these
 *   stat              the link's counters
 *   uptime            seconds since boot
 *   sysctl NAME       a sysctl's value (an integer or a string)
 *   sysctl NAME=N     an integer sysctl set to N, then read back. From here only a sysctl marked CTLFLAG_KERN can be
 *                     read or set: XNU's sysctl_root() refuses the others to the kernel with EPERM (whatever user
 *                     space may do), and the answer says so, with the error, instead of "no such name"
 *   bl                the panel's brightness: kern.hakios.brightness (0-255; -1 never set)
 *   bl N              the panel's brightness set to N (0-255) through hakios_panel_brightness(), as iOS's sets reach
 *                     it, and what came back: sent, the DSIM refused it (EIO), or no panel driver (ENODEV). The
 *                     Galaxy S9's driver also logs each set it sent ("s6e3ha8: brightness N sent ...", once a second)
 *   log               the kernel's log again from its start (what the kernel keeps of it: the first 256 KB)
 *   shot [N]          the panel's picture as it is now (what the display controller scans out: the boot framebuffer,
 *                     or with fb_dpp=1 / fb_flip=1 the presenter's buffer shown now, hakios_fb_scanned()), every
 *                     Nth pixel of every Nth row (1-16; 4 when not given), as binary on bulk IN, framed:
 *                       "SHOT w h stride rgb888 bytes\n", then the bytes (rows top to bottom, R G B), then "END\n"
 *                     The log is held back meanwhile (what came before the command is sent first, what comes during
 *                     it after END), so the picture is never mixed with it. tools/usb-shot.py asks for one and writes
 *                     a PNG. The panel is read while the display may be drawing it: a shot can catch half a frame
 *   camshot [N] [tp]  a picture from the Galaxy S9's front camera (hakios.exynos_camera.c, boot-arg cam_s9=6 or 7):
 *                     the camera's thread powers it up, meters and exposes, takes one RAW10 frame through CSIS1's WDMA,
 *                     powers it down (cam_s9=7: the newest frame of the stream, nothing powered up or down), demosaics
 *                     it (the whole 1632 x 1224 at N = 1, every Nth pixel for N of 2-16; 1 when not given) and
 *                     hands it here; it goes out framed as a shot's does, after the camera's log lines. "tp": CSIS1's
 *                     test pattern instead of the sensor. A capture that fails says "usb: camshot failed: ..." with
 *                     the link's and the WDMA's status registers instead. tools/usb-shot.py --cam
 *   irshot [N]        a picture from the Galaxy S9's iris camera (hakios.exynos_iris.c, boot-arg iris_s9=5): its
 *                     thread powers the S5K5F1 up, streams it (its IR LED pulsing with each frame) for one frame at the
 *                     most iris_s9_ms long, powers it down, and hands every Nth pixel (N of 2-8, 2 when not given:
 *                     1200 x 1200) here as grey RGB; it goes out as a camshot's does. tools/usb-shot.py --iris
 *   ufs               what the storage's ufs=3 did (hakios_ufs_summary in hakios.ufs.c): the step reached, the
 *                     self-test's and the fence test's results, the mode (native, or fallen back to ufs=2 and why),
 *                     reads, writes and refusals with the first three refusals' reasons. Said by itself too when
 *                     the host configures the link (ufs=3 only)
 *   wifi ...          the radio and en0: wifi, wifi scan, wifi ip, wifi ping [A.B.C.D] [SIZE], wifi dns NAME [A.B.C.D],
 *                     wifi tcp HOST [PORT [PATH]], wifi stat, wifi names [off] (drivers/wifi/hakios.wifi.c, hakios.sta.c,
 *                     drivers/net/hakios.net.c: what each does is said there)
 *   touch X Y [X2 Y2 [MS]]  a tap, or a swipe over MS milliseconds, given to iOS as the panel's are (X and Y in
 *                     thousandths of the screen's width and height): the phone worked from here, "shot" to see it
 *   button NAME       a press of lock, home, up or down, as its driver would give it
 *   usb               the link as it stands: the controller's registers, endpoint 0's state, the restarts, VBUS, the
 *                     USB-C switch (hakios.max77705.c). usb restart: the link restarted, as after a replug. usb drop MS:
 *                     the pull-up off for MS ms and on again, nothing else (the host sees an unplug). usb unplug MS: the
 *                     switch open and VBUS taken as gone for MS ms (an unplug from this side, the port's). usb muic MS:
 *                     the switch open for MS ms and nothing told to the link. usb watch off/on: the check for a link
 *                     that gets bus resets and no SETUP (see THE CABLE COMING AND GOING)
 *   return            end the run: the data volume saved, the drivers given back, the loader restarts the phone (into
 *                     TWRP on the S9). Done on a thread call of its own; should that not have ended the run after
 *                     RETURN_FORCE_SECONDS (the save or a driver's stop waiting on something under load), the poll goes
 *                     back to the loader without them, as a panic does
 * Not a shell: user space is not reached from here.
 *
 * THE CABLE COMING AND GOING. Nothing in the controller says the cable went: the PHY's VBUS is forced valid (the VBUS
 * pad is not wired to it, dt is_not_vbus_pad: hakios.exynos_usb.c step i), so there is no disconnect event, and on Android
 * it is the MUIC's and the charger's interrupts that make dwc3/otg.c stop the controller and bring it up again from
 * dwc3_core_init on every attach. Left alone, the link stayed "connected" with the old host's transfers on it; after a
 * replug it took the host's resets and chirps but no SETUP ever reached the event buffer, so the host retried for ever
 * while a restart of the phone was the only way out. So, as Android does it, from two sides:
 *   - VBUS: hakios.max77705.c reads it (the MUIC's BC_STATUS) four times a second and tells this file
 *     (hakios_usb_gadget_vbus). When it goes: every transfer ended, the pull-up off, the PHY down, the log kept in the
 *     ring (1 MB). When it comes back: the PHY's sequence again, the core reset and set up, the pull-up on (link_restart),
 *     and the log from where the host left it.
 *   - the link's own state: a host's reset without a SETUP after it, four in a row (or twelve resets without a
 *     configuration), means what a replug nobody saw would mean: the same restart, at most every 2 s, doubling to 30 s,
 *     until the host configures it. A USB controller reset on the host's side comes in by this door or by a plain reset.
 * The restart never waits on VBUS alone: a reading that stops coming puts a stopped link back up after 3 s.
 *
 * Boot-args:
 *   usb_gadget=<1-5>      the steps (0, or none: nothing)
 *   usb_gadget_soc=<name> the glue (exynos9810, the only one; the default)
 *   usb_gadget_clk=1      the glue may open a clock the boot left shut (Android's mux, divider and gate)
 *   usb_gadget_ldo=1      the glue puts the PHY's supplies into Android's USB mode (S9: S2MPS18 LDO9-14 mode 3, read back)
 *   usb_gadget_fs=1       full speed (12 Mbit/s) instead of high speed
 *   usb_gadget_susphy=1   let the link suspend the 2.0 PHY when idle (GUSB2PHYCFG SUSPHY, as Linux does; off by default)
 *   usb_gadget_poll=<ms>  the poll period while a host is attached (1-50; 2)
 *   usb_gadget_drain=<ms> on the way back to the loader, how long to keep sending the rest of the log (0-5000; 1000)
 *   usb_gadget_crlf=0     send the log's line ends as they are (LF) rather than CR LF
 *
 * Registers and fields: Samsung's kernel fork for the Galaxy S9 (Scion-Project/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9810,
 * lineage-24.0, e5906667068e), drivers/usb/dwc3/core.h and gadget.h, at the lines given next to each below; the
 * sequences after core.c dwc3_core_init (795-1000), dwc3_soft_reset (350-375), dwc3_core_config (140-253), dwc3_phy_setup
 * (637-765), gadget.c __dwc3_gadget_start (2025-2110), dwc3_gadget_set_ep_config (564-646), dwc3_gadget_start_config
 * (533-562), dwc3_gadget_run_stop (1733-1800), dwc3_gadget_reset_interrupt (2888), dwc3_gadget_conndone_interrupt (2998),
 * ep0.c (the control transfer's phases, 39-1160). GPL-2.0: read for facts only, no code taken. The event and TRB
 * layouts are those of core.h:1095-1205 and 676-710.
 *
 * Status: WRITTEN, NOT YET RUN on the phone. QEMU has no DWC3 device model (its DWC3 is the Xilinx boards' host-only
 * one), so the controller side is unchecked; the descriptors and requests are checked on the build machine.
