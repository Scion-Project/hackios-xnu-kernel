/*
 * The scion CPU governor: the control law, apart from any kernel or SoC (hakios.exynos_cpufreq.c measures and acts on it,
 * gov_policy=3; tools/gov-replay runs this file on a host).
 *
 *   rate    the level at which the busiest core would be 60% busy. Up at once; down after 300 ms, to the most any of those
 *           windows wanted. Never under the floor the input events ask for, never over the ceiling.
 *   cores   the fastest rates are for few big cores only, as in stock's hotplug governor. When the busiest core is heavy at
 *           the all-core limit, the rest idle and the little cores not heavy, for change_ms, the others are parked and the
 *           ceiling rises. They come back when the two cannot hold the load, when the rate no longer needs it, or at
 *           unpark_at_mc, read every window: a burst has its heat to spend and sustained load stays out. The caller lowers the rate before it brings a core back and never raises it before one is parked.
 *   pace    while a finger is down, the frames say whether the floor is enough: one that came late raises the floor two levels at
 *           once, and a floor that has seen only on-time frames for PACE_CALM_MS falls a level. A late frame is what load cannot see.
 *   heat    a temperature that is not read, not plausible or not recent means the safe rate and every core, at once.
 *
 * It never asks for a rate outside the APM's table or above the SoC's limits, and sends no voltage. The TMU driver's stop and
 * the caller's thermal ceiling (a level a second from the control point, the lowest at 96 C) stand above everything here.
