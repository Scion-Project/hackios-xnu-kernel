/*
 * The phone's storage: one block device and one character device for every GPT partition of its
 * UFS (/dev/ufs_NAME and /dev/rufs_NAME, NAME as the partition table has it). Read only, but for
 * the one place the data of Darwin lives (ufs_write=1, below).
 *
 * There is no UFS driver here, and none is needed. UEFI never exits on this port: Qualcomm's own
 * UFS driver (UFSDxe) has brought up the controller, its PHY, its clocks and power, and stays
 * resident, and xnuloader keeps serving the kernel from core 0 while the kernel runs on another
 * core (it already does for the battery). So with ufs=2 on its command line the loader publishes a
 * page (ufs_shared_pa=) with the table of partitions, a request and an answer, and a buffer; this
 * driver writes a request -- which partition, which blocks -- and core 0 reads them with that
 * driver's ReadBlocks into the buffer (xnuloader/loader.c, block_poll). Nothing in this kernel
 * touches the storage controller.
 *
 * Read only wherever a write could do harm, by construction. The block devices never write: the
 * strategy routine refuses, so no filesystem mounted from one can write, and opening one for
 * writing is refused. With ufs_write=1 one character device alone takes writes -- /dev/rufs_darwin,
 * the port's own partition -- and in it only whole blocks from UFS_WRITE_FIRST on, past the Darwin
 * volume and both cryptexes that the build writes from the computer (tools/darwin-write.py); that
 * is where the data volume of Darwin is kept between runs (userland/src/var_store.c). The partition
 * has to be the one the port was set up with (its name, size, place and logical unit here; its
 * GUIDs as well on the loader's side), and the loader refuses the same things over again and reads
 * every write back before it answers. Without ufs_write=1 nothing writes at all.
 *
 * One request at a time (the page has one), so requests are serialized by a mutex and split into
 * pieces of the buffer's size. The kernel writes only the request's cache lines and core 0 only
 * the answer's (see the loader), both through a mapping that does not cache here, so neither side
 * ever overwrites the other's. The data buffer, which only core 0's reads fill, is mapped cacheable
 * and the part of it an answer covers is invalidated here before it is copied out.
 *
 * The data volume of Darwin (HFS Plus, built into this kernel: bsd/hfs) is /dev/ufs_darwin_data: darwin from
 * UFS_WRITE_FIRST to its end, a block device of its own that reads and writes, there with ufs_write=1 only. A port
 * with no darwin has its loader offer one partition of its own instead, named in the loader's platform (the Galaxy
 * S9's USERDATA, given up to Darwin; UFS_DATA_PART here): all of it is the data volume, /dev/ufs_USERDATA_data, from
 * its first block, and the same rules hold for it as for darwin (see ufs_write_first). Its
 * writes go the same way as /dev/rufs_darwin's -- through the loader, which flushes and reads every one back before it
 * answers -- so a write that has come back is on the flash, which is what the file system's journal counts on. The
 * one and the other are not used in the same run: once the data volume has been opened for writing, the packed store
 * (var_store) is refused, and while a saver holds the store the data volume does not open for writing.
 *
 * ufs_check=1 reads, once at start, the partitions there are images of in the ROM's
 * firmware-update/ (bluetooth, xbl, tz, ...) through the same path and prints an FNV-1a hash of
 * as many bytes as each image has: tools/ufs-survey.py compares those with the images and with
 * what the loader read itself before the kernel started.
 *
 * ufs_native=4 (own mode): no loader page at all. This kernel's own driver (hakios.ufshc.c) has
 * the controller for the run -- QEMU's -device ufs, or the SoC's ufs_native_soc= names -- and
 * this file reads each logical unit's GPT itself (checked as ShengUfs checks it: the header's
 * signature, revision, size and CRC, the entries' CRC, the usable range, every partition inside
 * it, none overlapping another, no name twice) and makes the same /dev/ufs_NAME and /dev/rufs_NAME
 * of every partition. The table is kept in a struct loader_block of this kernel's own, so that
 * everything below reads it as it reads the loader's. ufs_native=5 only looks (hakios.ufshc.c);
 * ufs_native_step=1..4 stops the driver at a step of its bring-up (look, the link, NOP OUT, READ
 * CAPACITY) with nothing read here, 5 (QEMU's and the POCO's default; the S9's is 1) goes on to
 * LBA 0 and the GPTs.
 *
 * Writes in own mode go to one partition only, the one ufs_native_write=NAME names, through its
 * character device /dev/rufs_NAME, in whole blocks, and only if NAME is not one that must never be
 * written (ufs_never_written below: the S9's EFS, SEC_EFS, BOOT, RECOVERY, PARAM and the rest of its
 * boot chain and device-unique data, the POCO's modem file systems and boot images, any name with
 * "efs" in it) and its unit is neither a boot unit nor write protected. The controller's driver is
 * told the partition's blocks (ufshc_open_window) and refuses any write outside them on its own.
 * Closing the device synchronizes the device's cache. ufs_native_test=1 tries all of it at start:
 * refusals that must happen, and a write, read back and put back as it was, at three places of
 * the partition.

 * ---- ufs=3: this kernel's own UFS driver takes the controller, the loader's service its reference and fallback ----

 * The loader serves the storage as with ufs=2 (it takes ufs=3 for ufs=2, and refuses every request while the page
 * says this kernel's list is in: xnuloader/loader.c, block_poll). Here, before anything else of the run reads:
 *
 *   1. through the loader, the references: every unit's head (protective MBR, GPT header, table) and its backup GPT,
 *      and the first, middle and last block of every partition;
 *   2. own mode on the SoC (ufs_native_soc=, the S9's exynos9810 by default) to step 5, as UEFI left the controller
 *      (hakios.ufshc.c): looked at, this kernel's list in, NOP OUT, the units' descriptors and capacities;
 *   3. the self-test: each of the loader's units is the one logical unit whose capacity is the same and whose head
 *      reads the same here, byte for byte; its GPT read here is right (header and table CRCs) and holds every
 *      partition of the loader's table at the same blocks, of the same size; the backup GPT and every partition's
 *      three blocks read the same both ways;
 *   4. the fences, before any window: LBA 0-5 and both GPTs of every unit, every partition on the protected list
 *      (EFS, SEC_EFS, CPEFS, RADIO, CP_DEBUG, PERSISTENT, KEYSTORAGE, PARAM, UP_PARAM, STEADY, BOTA0-2, DTB, DTBO,
 *      BOOT, RECOVERY, NAD_REFER, OMR, HIDDEN and the rest of ufs_never_written, any name with "efs" in it), every
 *      logical unit but USERDATA's (the others hold the boot loaders), and everything of USERDATA's unit outside
 *      USERDATA. hakios.ufshc.c's whitelist refuses any write or SYNCHRONIZE CACHE that touches one, after its own
 *      window check, and says which; query writes, UNMAP, FORMAT UNIT, WRITE BUFFER, security protocols and vendor
 *      commands are not on its list at all;
 *   5. the window: USERDATA, and only with ufs_write=1 (the loader's offer, checked as for ufs=2), never with
 *      ufs_native_ro=1 (which also takes the loader's write path away for the run); otherwise everything is read
 *      only, in the whitelist itself;
 *   6. the switch: reads (and the data volume's writes) through this kernel's driver; the loader is asked nothing.
 *
 * Anything wrong before 6 gives the controller back (UEFI's list, interrupt enable and nexus types, read back) and
 * the run goes on through the loader as with ufs=2. A read that fails after 6 does the same, if the controller can
 * be given back; if it cannot, the storage is off for the run (nothing is asked of UEFI's driver behind a list that
 * is not its own). A write that fails is an error, never retried the other way. Every step is said into the
 * loader's log (loader_log_line), where the run's log is read.
 *
 * The run's outcome is kept in memory (nufs_sum) and said as a summary (hakios_ufs_summary): after the start, when
 * the USB console's host configures the link, on the console's "ufs", every 30 s with fps_log=1 or ufs_native_log=1,
 * when the run is ending (hakios_var_save_on_return: the kernel's log too, whose message buffer loader_return appends
 * last to the loader's log) and once more as the drivers are given back (hakios_ufs_quiesce, any way out, a panic's
 * too: the loader's log only).
