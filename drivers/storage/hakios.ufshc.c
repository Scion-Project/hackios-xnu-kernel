/*
 * The phone's UFS host controller, driven from this kernel: one driver for a standard UFS host
 * controller (UFSHCI, JESD223), what each SoC does differently behind a few hooks (struct
 * ufshc_soc below), and two ways of having the controller. hakios.ufshc.h says what it is and
 * compares it with UniXNU's ShengUfs, item by item; what was adopted from that comparison is
 * marked "(ShengUfs)" where it is done here.
 *
 * ---- shared (ufs_native=1: the POCO) ---------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Reading the storage through the loader (hakios.ufs.c) is one request at a time: Qualcomm's
 * UFSDxe reads synchronously on core 0, and its transfer request list has room for one request
 * only (UTRLBA points at a single descriptor, with UFSDxe's command descriptor right behind it,
 * where slots 8.. would be). The controller takes 32 at once. So for the length of a run this
 * kernel puts a list of its own into the controller: with nothing in flight, the list is stopped
 * (UTRLRSR 0), UTRLBA/UTRLBAU are pointed at the new one, the list is started again; at the end
 * (hakios_ufs_quiesce, from loader_return), what is in flight is waited for, the list stopped,
 * UEFI's address written back, the list started. The list and its command descriptors are in
 * memory the loader owns (it offers it in its page, with UEFI's address); the loader checks the
 * address on every way back from a run and puts UEFI's back itself if the kernel did not
 * (xnuloader/loader.c, hc_take_back), and neither reads nor writes for the kernel or for its log
 * while another list is in. While this kernel's list is in, it asks the loader for nothing.
 *
 * Nothing else of the controller is changed: no reset, no link startup, no UIC command, no
 * interrupt enable, aggregation, clock or power setting; the task management list is not
 * touched; IS and UTRLCNR are only read. UTRLCLR is written only to clear this kernel's own
 * slots when they do not finish at the end.
 *
 * Every slot of this list holds a whitelisted command at all times: TEST UNIT READY until it is
 * used for a read. Slot 0 is kept for the proof that the controller does read this list: after
 * every switch, before any read, slot 0's TEST UNIT READY is rung and must come back in this
 * list (its status written here). Were the controller still reading UEFI's list, the doorbell
 * would run UEFI's slot 0 instead -- so first UEFI's slot 0 must hold a read too (it does: the
 * loader's last use of the storage before a run is reading back the log it wrote), and the
 * proof costs nothing either way. Reads go in slots 1..31.
 *
 * The doorbell is rung only with interrupts off, after looking that this kernel's list is the
 * one in the controller and running, that the slot is free, and that the loader is not taking
 * the controller back (it says so in its page, then waits before it does). The list and the
 * command descriptors are mapped here without caching.
 *
 * ---- own (ufs_native=4; 5 looks only) -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This kernel has the controller for the run, and nothing else uses it meanwhile: the loader's
 * block service (ufs=2) is refused with it. The controller is the SoC's (ufs_native_soc=, below)
 * or the first UFSHCI on the PCI bus (QEMU's -device ufs). It is taken as UEFI left it: enabled,
 * a device present and the list ready, nothing in flight, no fatal status; then the interrupt
 * enable is saved and masked, UEFI's list stopped, this kernel's put in, read back and started
 * (ShengUfs's takeover, with UEFI's list and IE kept to be given back). On QEMU alone, a
 * controller UEFI did not enable is enabled from reset here (HCE, DME_LINKSTARTUP, fDeviceInit):
 * on a phone the PHY, its clocks and power are UEFI's to set up, and that is never done here.
 * Then NOP OUT; the device's power mode (QUERY READ ATTRIBUTE bCurrentPowerMode), and START STOP
 * UNIT to the device's well-known unit if it was left in power-down (ShengUfs); each general
 * logical unit's descriptor (QUERY READ DESCRIPTOR: enabled, boot LU, write protect, block size
 * and count), TEST UNIT READY and READ CAPACITY(16). hakios.ufs.c reads the GPTs.
 *
 * At the end (hakios_ufs_quiesce) what is in flight is waited for, the device's cache
 * synchronized if anything was written, this kernel's list stopped and UEFI's put back with its
 * interrupt enable and the vendor's registers as they were (or, on QEMU, the controller disabled
 * again if it was found so).
 *
 * The memory is this kernel's, physically contiguous and below 4 GB where the controller cannot
 * reach above (CAP's 64-bit bit clear (ShengUfs), or the SoC's DMA mask). The descriptors are
 * cached memory with the caches cleaned before every doorbell and invalidated after: so that no
 * line of the list ever holds a descriptor this kernel is writing beside one the controller is
 * writing back, own mode uses only even slots (a descriptor is 32 bytes, a cache line 64): slot 0
 * for the control commands, 2, 4 ... 30 for reads and writes.
 *
 * ---- what may be sent: the whitelist ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A command is made in a buffer of its own, and only one that passes ufshc_permitted() is ever
 * written into a slot; what the slot then holds is read back and must be the same and pass again
 * before the doorbell is rung. hc_refusal() checks the transaction type, the data direction in
 * the request descriptor, the UPIU's flags, the logical unit and the SCSI operation:
 *   always       READ(10)/READ(16) of a logical unit reads may go to now, with the CDB's length the
 *                UPIU's; TEST UNIT READY, REQUEST SENSE, INQUIRY, READ CAPACITY(10/16) of one
 *   own mode     NOP OUT; QUERY REQUESTs that read (descriptor, attribute, flag); START STOP UNIT
 *                with power condition ACTIVE, to the device's well-known unit (0xD0) only; the four
 *                above to any general unit; SET FLAG fDeviceInit only while enabling QEMU's
 *                controller from reset; WRITE(10)/WRITE(16) (FUA allowed) and SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)
 *                only into the one window ufshc_open_window() opened -- one logical unit, one range
 *                of blocks, the partition ufs_native_write= names -- and never anything else
 *   never        any other well-known unit (REPORT LUNS, BOOT, RPMB), task management, query writes,
 *                UNMAP, FORMAT UNIT, WRITE BUFFER, SECURITY PROTOCOL, MODE SELECT, data host to
 *                device outside the window, the W flag outside it
 * It is tried at the probe on made-up commands that must pass or be refused.
 *
 * ---- the SoCs (ufs_native_soc=) ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pci (the default)  QEMU's -device ufs: Red Hat 1b36:0013, class 01/09/01, BAR0 its registers. The
 *     PCI layer (bsd/dev/hakios.pci.c) enumerates bus 0 through the ECAM window the loader describes
 *     in /pci0 (QEMU virt: 0x4010000000) and keeps the BARs edk2's PCI bus driver assigned; the
 *     controller is the function of that class, its registers BAR0 (a 64-bit memory BAR), and the
 *     probe prints the BAR as it reads it in the function's configuration space. Standard UFSHCI:
 *     offsets in dwords, PRDT entries of 16 bytes, 256 KB each at most, UTRLCLR clears with zeros.
 * sm7325  the POCO X5 Pro's: ufshc@1d84000 ("ufs_mem" in its Android device tree). Standard as
 *     far as this driver goes: nothing of Qualcomm's vendor registers is needed for a controller
 *     UEFI's UFSDxe has brought up. Used in shared mode (ufs_native=1) as before.
 * exynos9810  the Galaxy S9's, from two GPL-2.0 sources, read for facts and nothing taken: [BSP]
 *     Samsung's kernel for the S9 (the Exynos 9810), and [ML] SheroAbi/galaxy-s9plus-mainline-linux
 *     at bcee6014fc2e44a4c4f1c34bca0a880d4b543ec3, mainline Linux 7.1 on the S9+ (the same SoC) with
 *     UFS read and written, src/ufs/ufs-exynos9810.c and src/mainline-dts/exynos9810-star2lte.dts:
 *     - the registers: ufs@11120000, reg = <0x11120000 0x200> (UFSHCI), <0x11121100 0x200> (the
 *       vendor's HCI registers), <0x11110000 0x8000> (UniPro), <0x11130000 0x100> (the UFS
 *       protector); SPI 242; "dma-coherent", and no iommus property (no SysMMU in front of it)
 *       -- [BSP] arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos/exynos9810-starlte_eur_open_26.dts, the ufs node; the
 *       same in [ML]'s ufs@11120000, which names them hci, vs_hci, unipro, ufsp, pma (0x11124000)
 *     - the request descriptor's response and PRDT offsets and lengths in bytes, not dwords
 *       (UFSHCD_QUIRK_PRDT_BYTE_GRAN: [BSP] drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs-exynos.c exynos_ufs_set_features,
 *       used in ufshcd.c ufshcd_host_memory_configure and ufshcd_map_sg; [ML] exynos_ufs_init)
 *     - command UPIU 1024 bytes, response UPIU 1024 bytes, then the PRDT (ALIGNED_UPIU_SIZE and
 *       struct utp_transfer_cmd_desc, drivers/scsi/ufs/ufshci.h)
 *     - a PRDT entry's size is the UFS protector's (FMP's) descriptor type, which only the secure
 *       world sets (SMC FMP_SECURITY): type 3 is 128 bytes -- the standard four words, then the
 *       inline encryption's IVs and keys -- type 0 the standard 16. S-Boot leaves type 3 ([ML], the
 *       comment at its SMC_CMD_FMP_SECURITY); [BSP] sets 3 too (exynos_fmp_sec_cfg, CFG_DESCTYPE_3,
 *       drivers/crypto/fmp/fmp.c; struct ufshcd_sg_entry with CONFIG_EXYNOS_FMP, which
 *       arch/arm64/configs/exynos9810-starlte_defconfig sets); [ML] sets 0. This kernel makes no
 *       SMC: it takes whichever UEFI's own reads use (below). The fourth word's bits 28-31 (FAS,
 *       DAS) 0 is no encryption (include/crypto/fmp.h; exynos_fmp_bypass)
 *     - at most 4 KB of data in one PRDT entry: the protector's data unit, in the data path even
 *       on type 0 -- [ML] measured larger segments wedging the doorbell with no error bit (its
 *       ufs_max_seg_size = 4096); [BSP] MAX_AES_XTS_TRANSFER_SIZE, include/crypto/fmp.h; the
 *       vendor's TXPRDT/RXPRDT_ENTRY_SIZE (0x00, 0x04 of its block) set to 12 by both drivers'
 *       host init (exynos_ufs_init_host) and checked here
 *     - HCI_UTRL_NEXUS_TYPE (vendor's 0x40): set to all ones at host init, then before each request
 *       the slot's bit set for a SCSI command and cleared for a query or NOP
 *       ([BSP] exynos_ufs_set_nexus_t_xfer_req, from ufshcd_queuecommand and ufshcd_exec_dev_cmd;
 *       [ML] exynos_ufs_setup_xfer_req)
 *     - UTRLCLR clears a slot with a one (BROKEN_REQ_LIST_CLR: [BSP] ufshcd_utrl_clear, [ML])
 *     - DMA below 4 GB: [BSP] exynos_ufs_dma_mask = DMA_BIT_MASK(32). [ML] runs with 64 bits (its
 *       dma_bits, "32 was a ruled-out experiment") once its entries were 4 KB; this driver keeps
 *       the BSP's 32 until the phone says otherwise
 *     - an error of the device may come back as OCS 7 (UFSHCD_QUIRK_BROKEN_OCS_FATAL_ERROR, [ML]):
 *       a unit's TEST UNIT READY is tried again on it while the units are looked for
 *     - interrupt aggregation not to be used (UFSHCI_QUIRK_SKIP_INTR_AGGR): not used here anyway
 *     - the Android partitions are in LUN 0's GPT: [ML]'s BOOT is /dev/sda10 and USERDATA
 *       /dev/sda25 (docs/03-installing.md); [BSP]'s FMP node names its block "sda". The general
 *       units are 0-7, the well-known ones REPORT LUNS 0x81, BOOT 0xB0, RPMB 0xC4 and the device
 *       0xD0 ([BSP] drivers/scsi/ufs/ufs.h); which general units are enabled, and which are boot
 *       units, is read from each one's unit descriptor on the phone, not assumed
 *     - for a controller UEFI has brought up nothing else of the vendor's is needed for transfers:
 *       the rest of host init (data reorder, AXI burst, clock gating, the 1 us counter, the
 *       protector's descriptor type and SMU, by SMC) is set up once and is UEFI's (and S-Boot's);
 *       HCI_SW_RST (vendor's 0x50) resets UniPro and the link, and is never written here. [ML]
 *       found transfers stalling with the controller's clock gating on and leaves it off; this
 *       driver writes neither HCI_CLKSTOP_CTRL nor HCI_FORCE_HCS, it prints what UEFI left
 *     Before its list goes out, UEFI's own descriptors are read: a read UEFI made must be laid out
 *     as these facts allow (offsets in bytes; entries of 128 or 16 bytes whose lengths add up to the
 *     UPIU's expected length, the size then taken for this driver's), or the S9 is not taken.
 *     ufs_native=5 shows all of it and changes nothing.
 *
 * Checked: shared mode run on the POCO (as before this file was made generic). Own mode run in
 * QEMU 11.1 on -device ufs with two ufs-lu units. exynos9810: compiled only, NEVER RUN on the
 * phone; off unless ufs_native=4 ufs_native_soc=exynos9810 is asked for, which nothing does by
 * default (start with ufs_native=5).
