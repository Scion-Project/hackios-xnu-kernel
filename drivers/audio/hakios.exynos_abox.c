/*
 * The Galaxy S9's speakers (starlte, Exynos 9810), the SoC's side: ABOX, Samsung's audio block, driven from the AP with
 * its own CPU off ("bypass", no firmware). What iOS plays goes memory -> RDMA0 -> SPUS (ABOX's stream bus, chain 0, no
 * ASRC) -> SIFS1 (not the mixer, SIFS0: see abox_route) -> UAIF1, an I2S master, -> the two MAX98512 amplifiers. The amplifiers' I2C is another
 * driver's, reached only through the hook of sys/hakios.exynos_abox.h, which also has UAIF1's format and every register
 * fact used here (FACT or INFERRED, with the file it comes from). Only with boot-arg abox=N on this phone (the SoC's
 * registers at 0x10000000); every address below is the S9's.
 *
 * THE STEPS. abox=N makes the first N of eight and stops; 0 or none leaves ABOX alone. Each step says what it will touch
 * before it does, and every write to a register of the SoC is said with what it reads back. A step that does not find
 * what it needs ends the sequence; with N under 8 everything is put back at the end (the stream stopped, the pins idle,
 * the domain off again if this driver switched it on).
 *   1  look     the PMU's AUD domain, its pads' retention, ABOX's CPU power; ACPM's AUD DVFS rate. Nothing written, and
 *               nothing of the AUD block read (it may have no power)
 *   2  power    the AUD domain on (PMU 0x14064000 [3:0] = 0xF, then 0x14064004 [3:0] == 0xF) unless it is; the DTZPC
 *               restore, SMC 0x82000410 (1, 0x17C10204); ABOX's IP_INDEX must read "ABOX"; ABOX's CPU kept off (bypass)
 *   3  clocks   SYSREG MISC_CON = 1; CMU_AUD's dividers (ACLK 589.824 MHz, its APB 196.608, AUDIF 73.728, UAIF1's BCLK
 *               1.536) and UAIF1's mux, then PLL_AUD at 1179.648 MHz (M 45 P 1 S 0 K 24319), stable; the Q-channels of
 *               ABOX's "cpu" clock (abox_enable() turns it on before any firmware is there), UAIF1's BCLK and the
 *               SysMMU asked on if the hardware does not gate them itself
 *   4  pins     gpb1-0..3 to UAIF1 (function 2, pull 1), then the pads' retention released (PMU 0x4170 bit 28, 0x1424 bit 0)
 *   5  UAIF1    master, I2S, 2 x 16 bits (CTRL0 0x01000014, CTRL1 0x0984F000); then on for 50 ms with nothing routed to
 *               it: its status, and whether BCLK and LRCLK toggle at the pins (gpb1's DAT sampled)
 *   6  route    SPUS chain 0: RDMA0 in, no ASRC, out to SIFS1 (SPUS_CTRL0 [3:0] = 0, SPUS_CTRL1 [18:16] = 0); UAIF1
 *               from SIFS1 (ROUTE_CTRL0 [7:4] = 2) (with abox_route=0 the mixer, SIFS0, instead); SPUS's sample banks
 *               read, and RDMA0's given 512 bytes if it has none (SBANK_RDMA0 SIZE, 0x17C50220)
 *   7  stream   ABOX's SysMMU switched to pass addresses through (the boot leaves it translating); SYSPOWER_CTRL 1 and
 *               the ACLK and BCLK_UAIF1 Q-channels held on; a ring of 8 periods of 512 frames below 4 GB (in abox_rmem,
 *               the kernel's RAM being above it); RDMA0
 *               programmed (its burst length 8 if it reads 0); UAIF1 on, then RDMA0 on (Samsung's order); the amplifiers started; a tone (1 kHz, -20 dBFS,
 *               both channels) for abox_secs, through the speakers' guard; RDMA0's status every millisecond at first
 *               and every second after; then the amplifiers stopped, RDMA0 off, UAIF1 off
 *   8  sink     the same stream, kept running for good (and, with abox_mic=1, the microphone for iOS; with the codec's
 *               cs47l93_hp=1, the headphones: their sections below): /dev/hakios-audio's sink (sys/hakios.audio.h) into a ring, a
 *               thread of ours from there through the guard into each period RDMA0 has finished (silence when there is
 *               nothing), at the volume iOS sets (its "below", taken off digitally before the guard, as the POCO's
 *               amplifiers take it off in their own volume); the amplifiers started when iOS plays and stopped after
 *               3 s of silence or while it is muted
 *
 * Boot-args:
 *   abox=N             the first N of ABOX's eight steps (1 only looks, 7 plays a tone, 8 serves iOS); 0 or none: left alone
 *   abox_secs=S        how long step 7 plays its tone, 1 to 10 seconds (3)
 *   abox_route=0       UAIF1 from SIFS0, the mixer (SPUS_CTRL0 OUT 1, MIXP_FORMAT, ROUTE_CTRL0 [7:4] = 1), instead of SIFS1
 *                      (SPUS OUT0 straight, SPUS_CTRL1 [18:16] = 0, ROUTE_CTRL0 [7:4] = 2). On the phone the mixer's way
 *                      stalls: RDMA0 reads 32 bytes and no more (the mixer's sample bank reads 0; calliope would set it up),
 *                      where SIFS1's runs at 192000 bytes a second (3 November); 1, SIFS1, is the default
 *   abox_rdma_ctrl0=V  bits of RDMA0's CTRL0 besides ENABLE, to try a format there (none: as it reads after reset)
 *   abox_rdma_ctrl1=V  RDMA0's CTRL1 (none: as it reads after reset)
 *   abox_vol=V         RDMA0's VOL_FACTOR [23:0] (none: 0x800000 if it reads 0, else left)
 *   abox_bclk_on=1     ABOX never gates UAIF1's BCLK (QCHANNEL_DISABLE bit 3), as Samsung does for UAIF0 while it plays
 *   abox_gain=N        eighths of a dB of gain before the speakers' guard, 0 to 96 (0)
 *   abox_dvfs=KHZ      ACPM's AUD DVFS domain (index 9) set to this before step 3 (none: left as found, only read)
 *   abox_sbank=BYTES   RDMA0's sample bank in SPUS (step 6), a multiple of 16 up to 16368 (512, set only when it reads 0;
 *                      given, it is set whatever it reads; 0: left as read)
 *   abox_burst=N       RDMA0's CTRL0 BURST_LEN [22:19], 1 to 15 (8, set only when it reads 0; given, set anyway; 0: left)
 *   abox_mmu_off=0     refuse a translating SysMMU instead of switching it off (1: CTRL 0, as found needed on the S9)
 *   abox_syspower=0    leave SYSPOWER_CTRL ("DRAM on") and the ACLK/BCLK_UAIF1 Q-channels alone while streaming (1: set)
 *   abox_rdma_fmt=0    leave RDMA0 CTRL0's FORMAT/FUNC/BUF_UPDATE and SBANK_LIMIT as they read (1: calliope's values)
 *   abox_ring_pa=PA    the ring at this physical address of abox_rmem (0xFB200000 + 40 MB) instead of the kernel's memory
 *   abox_mic=1         with abox=8: /dev/hakios-mic, the codec's main microphone for iOS, recorded through UAIF0 and WDMA1
 *                      whenever iOS listens (its section below; the codec made ready by cs47l93=6); 0 or none: no device
 *
 * THE USB CONSOLE. "abox" on hakios.dwc3.c's console (usb_gadget=5) says the state of the path and the amplifiers' own
 * status registers, and "abox tone S" makes steps 1-7 again while the phone runs, with what "abox set" changed: a
 * run on the phone without a new image for every guess. "abox rec S" records S seconds of the codec's microphone
 * through UAIF0 and WDMA1 (the capture section below; the codec set up first by "codec mic", hakios.cs47l93.c).
 * "abox r/w BLOCK OFF" reads and writes registers. See
 * hakios_abox_console() below.
 *
 * WHERE IT COMES FROM. The S9 kernel (github.com/ExyHyperBrick/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9810, lineage-24.0), GPL-2.0,
 * read for facts and not copied; which part of this file does the work of what there:
 *   step 2   cal-if/exynos9810/flexpmu_cal_local_exynos9810.h (aud_on), cal-if/pmucal_local.c pmucal_local_enable(),
 *            exynos-el3_mon.c exynos_pd_tz_restore(), linux/smc.h; the device tree's pd-aud (cal_id 0xB1380000: index 0,
 *            no PMIC write in cal-if.c cal_pd_control(), unlike the G3D's); abox.c abox_cpu_enable()/abox_cpu_power()
 *   step 3   abox.c abox_enable() (MISC_CON, the clocks) and abox_register_bclk_usage() (PLL 48 kHz family, AUDIF for
 *            uaif_max_div 512); abox_if.c abox_if_startup() and abox_uaif_hw_params() (BCLK = rate x channels x width);
 *            cal-if/ra.c ra_set_pll()/ra_pll_set_pmsk()/ra_set_div_rate()/ra_req_enable_qch(), pll_spec.c, and
 *            exynos9810/cmucal-*.c (the registers, the PLL table, BLK_AUD's dividers); clk-exynos9810.c (which clock
 *            each of the device tree's "pll", "cpu", "audif", "bus", "bclk", "bclk_gate" is)
 *   step 4   the device tree's aud-i2s1-bus/-idle; pinctrl-exynos.c (exynos9810 bank layout); abox.c abox_pad_retention()
 *   step 5   abox_if.c abox_uaif_set_fmt(), abox_uaif_hw_params(), abox_uaif_trigger(), abox_uaif_shutdown();
 *            exynos9810_madera.c (UAIF1's dai_fmt); abox.c probe (the SIFs' 48000/S16/2 defaults)
 *   step 6   abox.c: the DAPM muxes (spus_in/asrc/out, uaif1_spk, sifs1) and abox_flush_mixp(), abox_sif_format_put_ipc()
 *            (SPUS_CTRL1's MIXP_FORMAT, written by the AP), abox_try_to_asrc_off() (ASRC off when the rates and widths match)
 *   step 7   abox_rdma.c (hw_params, prepare, trigger, pointer, hw_free and its 40 ms disable barrier, the UAIF FIFO's
 *            0.6-1.2 ms); soc-pcm.c and the RDMA links' SND_SOC_DPCM_TRIGGER_POST_PRE (start: UAIF first, stop: RDMA
 *            first); drivers/iommu/exynos-iommu*.h (the SysMMU's CTRL values); include/sound/samsung/abox_ipc.h
 *   steps 6-7, the sample bank and the burst length: the Galaxy S10's kernel (github.com/ivanmeler/
 *            android_kernel_samsung_beyondlte, GPL-2.0, read for facts): abox_soc.h, abox_cmpnt_v20.c
 *            abox_cmpnt_adjust_sbank(), abox_rdma.c hw_params, Kconfig (ABOX version 0x10100 for the 9810)
 *
 * WITH THE FIRMWARE OFF, WHAT ANDROID DOES. Nothing that plays. abox_enable() switches the clocks on, puts back the
 * registers the AP owns (regcache_sync of the regmap: SYSTEM_CONFIG0, REMAP, DYN_CLOCK_OFF, QCHANNEL_DISABLE,
 * ROUTE_CTRL0-2, SPUS_CTRL0-3, the SIFS counts, SPUM_CTRL0-3, UAIFn CTRL0/1, DSIF, RDMA3's VOL_FACTOR) and sets the pins,
 * then abox_download_firmware() returns -EAGAIN while calliope_sram.bin/calliope_dram.bin are not loaded, and
 * abox_enable() returns before abox_cpu_power()/abox_cpu_enable(): calliope_state stays CALLIOPE_DISABLED. Every message
 * a stream sends (PCM_SET_BUFFER, PCM_PLTDAI_HW_PARAMS, _PREPARE, _TRIGGER, the mixer's format) then goes through
 * abox_process_ipc(), where abox_can_calliope_ipc() says "Invalid calliope state" and drops it. abox_uaif_set_fmt,
 * _hw_params and _trigger still write UAIF1 directly (snd_soc_component_update_bits on the regmap), and the DAPM muxes
 * still write SPUS_CTRL0/1 and ROUTE_CTRL0, so UAIF1 would clock out whatever SIFS0 holds; but nothing ever writes
 * RDMA0's BUF_*, STR_POINT or CTRL0, and abox_rdma_pointer() reads STATUS with PROGRESS 0 and says 0: the stream stalls.
 * So Android never runs RDMA without calliope, and its source cannot say whether RDMA0 runs that way; what it does say:
 *   - RDMA0's registers are plain registers on the AP's bus: the AP reads STATUS (abox_rdma_pointer) and CTRL0
 *     (abox_rdma_disable_barrier) directly, and writes RDMA3's VOL_FACTOR (0x1318) through the same regmap
 *   - what RDMA0 needs that calliope gives it: its BUF_*, STR_POINT and CTRL0/1, SPUS's sample bank (reset 0), the
 *     buffer as an IOVA (0x91000000, SysMMU on) and ABOX's GIC for its interrupts. Bypass gives the first two from the
 *     AP, a physical address with the SysMMU off for the third, and polls instead of the fourth
 *   - calliope's other duties for a plain stream (the mixer's rate, the ASRC, the DSM speaker protection) are either
 *     off here (the ASRC: try-to-asrc-off holds at 48 kHz 16-bit) or replaced (the guard for DSM)
 *
 * WHAT IS INFERRED, NOT READ. Samsung's ABOX firmware programs RDMA0; the kernel only names its registers.
 *   - RDMA0: BUF_STR = the ring's first byte, BUF_END = one past its last, BUF_OFFSET = a period's bytes, STR_POINT =
 *     BUF_STR, VOL_FACTOR 0x800000 as unity (Q1.23; any reading of 0x800000 is at most unity). Why: the registers' names,
 *     and that PCM_SET_BUFFER gives the firmware exactly an address, a period's bytes and a count; STATUS's period
 *     offset plus count in the period (abox_rdma_pointer) says the hardware keeps periods itself. The format (16-bit,
 *     stereo) is in no named field: CTRL0's other bits and CTRL1 are left as they read after reset unless abox_rdma_ctrl0/1
 *     say otherwise, and the bytes RDMA0 reads per second are measured and said (192000 is 48 kHz 16-bit stereo; 96000
 *     would say mono or 8-bit, 384000 32-bit or 4 channels). The ring sits at the start of 256 KB of zeroes (all that
 *     STATUS's 13-bit offset can point into, twice), so a different meaning of BUF_END reads silence, not memory of
 *     someone else's; a position outside the ring stops the stream.
 *   - The SIFS0 mixer's rate is told to the firmware (SET_MIXER_SAMPLE_RATE) and no register holds it: taken to follow
 *     the UAIF that pulls from it (48 kHz). RDMA0, the mixer and UAIF1 are all 48 kHz 16-bit stereo, so Samsung's own
 *     rule (abox_try_to_asrc_off) leaves the ASRC off.
 *   - The SysMMU passes addresses through when CTRL's bit 2 (on in Linux's CTRL_ENABLE 0x5 and CTRL_BLOCK 0x7, off in
 *     CTRL_DISABLE 0 and CTRL_BLOCK_DISABLE 3) is clear: checked before RDMA0 is given an address, and refused when set;
 *     when only bit 1 (blocked) is set, CTRL_DISABLE (0) is written. The ring is below 4 GB (RDMA's address registers are
 *     32 bits) and its physical address is what RDMA0 is given.
 *   - The DMA does not snoop the processors' caches: every period is cleaned to memory after it is written.
 *   - The DTZPC restore returns 0 when it succeeds (as hakios.mali.c assumes for the G3D's).
 * What a firmware mode would settle: run calliope once (abox_fw=1, a mode to add) and read RDMA0's registers back after
 * its PCM_PLTDAI_TRIGGER: CTRL0/CTRL1's format bits, what BUF_END and BUF_OFFSET hold, VOL_FACTOR's unity. Note that the
 * firmware sees memory through the SysMMU at IOVAs (its DRAM image at 0x80000000, RDMA buffers at 0x91000000 + 1 MB x n,
 * abox.h): that mode needs ABOX's SysMMU given page tables, where bypass needs it off. Steps 1-6 are the firmware mode's
 * too (abox_enable() does the same power, clocks, pins and UAIF/route writes around booting the CPU), and step 7 calls
 * RDMA0 only through `struct abox_dma` below, which that mode would give through IPC instead.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DONE. No PMIC is written (the AUD domain's power-on has no PMIC step in the CAL); ACPM is only read unless
 * abox_dvfs= asks. ABOX's GIC, its CPU and its SRAM are not touched; of the WDMAs only WDMA1, by "abox rec". No interrupt is used: RDMA0's status is
 * polled from a thread of ours every 2 ms. The amplifiers are not touched except through their driver's hook.
 *
 * THE SPEAKERS' GUARD (drivers/audio/hakios.guard.c) applies: on Android the S9's speakers are protected by Maxim's DSM
 * running on ABOX's CPU (the device tree's dsm.bin), which does not run here. Every period, silence too, goes through
 * it, reckoned with the amplifiers at Android's loudest (attenuation 0, the most careful), after abox_gain.
 *
 * Status (3 November, phone 2 of the S9s): steps 1-6 run as written (the AUD domain was on, ABOX answers, PLL_AUD locks,
 * UAIF1's LRCLK toggles at gpb1-1 at 48 kHz); step 7 then refused the SysMMU the boot leaves on (CTRL 0x4), and the
 * kernel's own RAM is all above 4 GB. Hence abox_mmu_off, abox_rmem for the ring, and calliope's RDMA fields. AUDIO.md
 * in the starlte repository has each run.

 * ---- the USB console's "abox" (hakios.dwc3.c) ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Only once abox=N has been given at boot (N of 1 at least: the phone and its blocks are known). What it does:
 *   abox                     the state now: the AUD domain, ABOX's power, routing, UAIF1, RDMA0, the SysMMU; and the
 *                            amplifiers' own status registers, when their driver has registered (max98512=3)
 *   abox tone [S]            steps 1-7 again, now, with the tone for S seconds (1-10; abox_secs), when nothing runs and
 *                            no stream serves iOS (abox=8)
 *   abox r BLOCK OFF [N]     N words (1-64) of BLOCK (abox, mmu, cmu, sysreg, gpio, pmu) from OFF
 *   abox w BLOCK OFF VALUE   one word written to abox, mmu or gpio, and read back (for experiments: never the PMU or CMU)
 *   abox set NAME VALUE      one of abox_route, _rdma_ctrl0, _rdma_ctrl1, _vol, _bclk_on, _sbank, _burst, _mmu_off,
 *                            _syspower, _rdma_fmt, _ring_pa, _secs (without the "abox_"), for the next "tone"
 * Each answer goes into the kernel's log, and so out on the USB console.
