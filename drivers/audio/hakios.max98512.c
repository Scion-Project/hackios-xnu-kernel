/*
 * The Galaxy S9's speakers (starlte, Exynos 9810): two Maxim MAX98512 amplifiers, 0x39 and 0x3A on the HSI2C of USI07 of
 * PERIC1 (0x108C0000), fed over I2S by UAIF1 of ABOX, the SoC's audio block, which drives both clocks. Only with boot-arg
 * max98512=N on this phone (the SoC's registers at 0x10000000). Every address and number below is this phone's.
 *
 * The bus (the phone's device tree: hsi2c@108C0000, alias hsi2c18, and what its clocks and pins name): the controller at
 * 0x108C0000, its input clock 200 MHz (default-clk), 400 kHz (no clock-frequency: i2c-exynos5.c's fast mode); its clocks
 * USI07 and GATE_USI07 of CMU_PERIC1 (0x10800000): the gates GATE_CLK_PERIC1_USI07_USI +0x203C,
 * RSTnSYNC_CLK_PERIC1_USI07_USI +0x2094, USI07_USI's IPCLK +0x20E4 and PCLK +0x20E8, the Q-channel +0x3038, the divider
 * +0x181C (7 bits), PERIC1's IP mux +0x0120; the USI's mode word usi@10811024 (usi_v2_mode "i2c": the words go two to a
 * USI from USI06's at 0x1081101C, as USI10's at 0x1081103C is the flashlight's bus); SCL gpp4-4 and SDA gpp4-5, function
 * 2 (hsi2c18-bus), in PERIC1's GPIO (0x10830000, bank gpp4 at +0: CON [23:16]).
 *
 * The amplifiers (max98512@39 under it): one codec of Android's over two chips, the main one at 0x39 (maxim,sub_reg 0x3A
 * the other, maxim,mono_stereo 1). In the stereo mode 0x39 plays I2S channel 0 (PCM_RX_EN_A 0x01, PCM_TO_SPK_MONOMIX_A
 * and _B 0x00 0x00) and 0x3A channel 1 (0x02, 0x41 0x01). Which speaker each drives is not in the tree; that 0x39 is the
 * top one (the earpiece, a speaker in stereo) is read from the driver: its receiver gain ("Rcv Digital Gain") is set on
 * 0x39 alone, its mono mode on 0x39 plays at the receiver's gain, and its brownout current limit for 0x39 (0x16) is the
 * lower (0x3E for 0x3A; the tree sets neither). No reset or enable pin and no supply in the tree: the node's pins are the
 * bus's (max98512-i2c: gpp4-4/5, their pull in power-down) and the two interrupts' (amp-int: gpm2-0 and gpm3-0 of CMGP),
 * left alone here (nothing waits on them). maxim,registers-of-amp and maxim,vmon_slot are read by nothing in the driver;
 * there are no vmon/imon slot numbers, so the IV sense would be the driver's own (slot 0 for 0x39, 1 for 0x3A,
 * interleaved: interleave_mode 1), and it stays off here.
 *   Two revisions, with different maps: REV_ID (0x0402) at 0x40 or above is the first, else REV_ID at 0x0600 at 0x40 or
 *   above is the "B", whose registers from 0x20 sit elsewhere (address(): +3, +1, +2, -2, -18, -13 by range;
 *   GLOBAL_SHDN 0x0500, SOFT_RESET 0x0501). Addresses are 16 bits (the high byte first), values 8.
 *
 * The format (the machine driver exynos9810_madera.c, its UAIF1 link): SND_SOC_DAIFMT_I2S | NB_NF | CBS_CFS, I2S with
 * neither clock inverted and the amplifiers slaves of both. ABOX's side (abox_if.c: abox_uaif_set_fmt, _hw_params) is
 * WS_MODE 0, BCLK_POLARITY 1, WS_POLAR 0, MODE 1 (master), SBIT_MAX the width less one and BCLK = rate * channels *
 * width, the width and the channels being ABOX's (abox_hw_params_fixup_helper). In the MAX98512 (max98512_dai_set_fmt,
 * _dai_hw_params, _set_clock): PCM_MASTER_MODE [1:0] 0, PCM_MODE_CFG [2] 0 (the BCLK edge), [5:3] 0 (I2S), [7:6] the
 * width (1 16, 2 24, 3 32 bits), PCM_CLK_SETUP [3:0] the BCLKs a frame (2 32, 3 48, 4 64), PCM_SR_SETUP1 [3:0] and
 * PCM_SR_SETUP2 [7:4] 8 (48 kHz), PCM_SR_SETUP2 [3:0] 5 (24 kHz, the IV ADC's when interleaved), SPK_SRC_SEL [1:0] 0
 * (the PCM input), PDM_RX_CTRL [0] 0.
 *
 * What is written, in what order (the first revision's numbering; in Android's order, in which each register goes to
 * 0x39 and then to 0x3A):
 *   configure: start()'s steps 1-3, and max98512=2 at boot (as for 48 kHz, 2 x 16 bits)
 *     GLOBAL_SHDN 0; SOFT_RESET 1, then REV_ID answering again and GLOBAL_SHDN [0], AMP_EN [0] reading 0
 *       (max98512_probe: its software reset; the shutdown before it is this driver's)
 *     MEAS_EN 0 (the IV sense off: Android turns it on for DSM, which does not run here); PCM_TX_HIZ_CTRL_A/B 0xFF;
 *       MONOMIX_A/B (above); AMP_VOL_CTRL the level (below) and SPK_GAIN 0, muted (Android's probe: 0x40 and 5);
 *       AMP_DSP_CFG 0x01 (the DC blocker, the volume ramp); MEAS_DSP_CFG 0xF7; BOOST_CTRL0 0x1C (10 V), BOOST_CTRL1
 *       0x3E, BOOST_CTRL3 0x01; MEAS_ADC_CFG 0x07, MEAS_ADC_BASE 0x00 0x0B, ADC_CH0-2_DIVIDE 2, ADC_CH0-2_FILT_CFG 0x0C;
 *       SQUELCH 0x10; BROWNOUT_EN 0x07, LVL_HOLD 0xFF, LVL1-3_THRESH 0xA0 0x30 0x10, THRESH_HYSTERYSIS 0x0F,
 *       AMP_LIMITER_ATK_REL 0x76; LVL1-3_CUR_LIMIT 0x16 (0x39) and 0x3E (0x3A) with LVL1-3_AMP1_CTRL1 6, 9, 12 and
 *       CTRL2-3 0, LVL4_CUR_LIMIT 0, LVL4_AMP1_CTRL1 0; ENV_TRACK_VOUT_HEADROOM 0x0A, ENV_TRACK_CTRL 0x01;
 *       BOOST_BYPASS_1 0x05, _2 0x00 (automatic bypass) when the top one is a B and 0x02 (off) when not, _3 0x01
 *       (max98512_probe; its write of 0x10 to ENV_TRACK_BOOST_VOUT_READ, a reading by its name and volatile in B's
 *       map, is left out)
 *     PCM_TX_HIZ_CTRL_A 0xFF, PCM_TX_EN_A/B 0: nothing sent back on the bus (max98512_reinit_reg; adc_config's IV
 *       slots are not opened); CLK_MON 0
 *     with a B among them: INT_EN1, INT_EN2, IRQ_CTRL 0, PCM_MASTER_MODE 0, PCM_CLK_SETUP 0x22, SSM_CFG 0x05,
 *       BROWNOUT_AMP_GAIN_ATK_REL 0, ENV_TRACK_BOOST_VOUT_DELAY, _REL_RATE, _HOLD_RATE 0 (max98512_probe)
 *     the format, above (max98512_dai_set_fmt, max98512_dai_hw_params, max98512_set_clock)
 *   unmute: start()'s steps 4-6 (max98512_dai_mute_stream -> __max98512_spk_enable, the stereo mode)
 *     SPK_GAIN [2:0] and AMP_VOL_CTRL [6:0], the level; MEAS_EN [1:0] 0; BROWNOUT_LVL2/3_THRESH 0x30 0x10 (0x40 0x20
 *     with the battery at 5 C or under: Android compares tenths of a degree with 50); BOOST_BYPASS_2 again; then 0x39's
 *     PCM_RX_EN_A, MONOMIX_A/B, AMP_EN [0] 1, AMP_EN [7:6] 2 (DEM), GLOBAL_SHDN [0] 1, and the same for 0x3A
 *   mute: stop() (max98512_spk_enable(0))
 *     GLOBAL_SHDN [0] 0, AMP_EN [0] 0, MEAS_EN [1:0] 0, then 15 ms with the clocks still running, for the ramp down
 *
 * The level. Android's speaker is +15 dB (maxim,spk-gain 5; SPK_GAIN [2:0] is 0 mute, then +3 to +18 dB in 3 dB steps) at
 * 0 dB digital (0x40; AMP_VOL_CTRL [6:0] is -16 dB and 0.25 dB a step), its receiver +3 dB at -3 dB (maxim,spk-gain-rcv
 * 1, maxim,digital-gain-rcv 0x34). Here both start at the receiver's level, 15 dB under Android's speaker.
 * max98512_gain=N raises the bottom one (1 to 5: +3 to +15 dB); the top one stays at the receiver's, being the earpiece.
 * Nothing ever sets more than SPK_GAIN 5 at 0 dB: the allow-list caps both registers (and BOOST_CTRL0 at Android's 10 V).
 *
 * The speakers' protection. Android's is Maxim's DSM on ABOX's DSP (dsm.bin), from the amplifiers' current and voltage
 * sense. None of that runs here, so the IV sense stays off, and what is left is the amplifiers' own (the DC blocker, the
 * brownout limiter, the boost's current limit, their thermal shutdown), the low level above, and whatever the feeder of
 * UAIF1 does to the samples: drivers/audio/hakios.guard.c (the POCO's: a high-pass, power and peak limits) is not in
 * this path; it would have to be built for the S9 and run on what is fed to UAIF1.
 *
 * Every write goes through one function that takes only the registers above (rules[]), none beyond its largest value,
 * and reads it back; a write that does not read back, or a bus that fails, ends writing for the run: both amplifiers
 * are shut down (GLOBAL_SHDN, AMP_EN) and start() refuses from then on. Waits are by the clock (deadline_us), not
 * delay(), which may sleep a tick. One transfer at a time (bus_lock), one start, stop or step at a time (amp_lock).
 *
 *   max98512=1    a look: the bus brought up (its clocks, the USI, the pins), both chips' revisions and registers;
 *                 nothing is written to them
 *   max98512=2    ... and both set up as for 48 kHz, 2 x 16 bits, shut down and muted; their registers again
 *   max98512=3    ... and both handed to ABOX (hakios_abox_set_amp): UAIF1's start turns them on, its stop off
 *   max98512_gain=N  the bottom speaker's gain at start, 1 to 5 (+3 to +15 dB; 1); the top one's is always 1
 *
 * Started on its own (STARTUP, as hakios.thermal.c is), not from hakios.input.c: that file is one of patch 1203's.
 *
 * Sources: the phone's device tree (hsi2c@108C0000 and max98512@39, usi@10811024, the hsi2c18-bus, max98512-i2c and
 * amp-int pins, the sound node's uaif@1, abox_uaif@1), Samsung's max98512.c and max98512.h, exynos9810_madera.c, abox.c
