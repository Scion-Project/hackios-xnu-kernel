/*
 * HakiosBluetooth: the registry entry by which iOS's bluetoothd finds the S9's Bluetooth (drivers/bluetooth/
 * hakios.bcm4361_bt.c, bt=7).
 *
 * bluetoothd 16.5 (iPhone X build) looks for a service named "bluetooth" (the device tree's node on an iPhone) and
 * takes the controller's address from its property local-mac-address; with none, or all zeros, it says "Not a valid
 * MAC address (all 00s)" and "No bluetooth on this device." and exits (seen on the phone, 3 November). Its transport
 * it takes from BT_HCI_TRANSPORT (H4:POSIX:com.apple.uart.bluetooth,4000000, set by the job: userland's BT=1), which
 * opens the C driver's kernel control. BlueTool, through which bluetoothd runs its boot and init scripts first, looks
 * the same service up: "device -D -S" opens the control at transport-speed (when the variable BT_BAUDRATE does not say
 * otherwise), and transport-encoding, absent here, would make it AppleBT (6) or PCIe (7) instead of a UART (any other
 * value, 8 when there is none). So: the node's own service if the device tree has one, else ours, named "bluetooth",
 * under the platform, with the chip's address (in the order it is written, not HCI's) and transport-speed, the UART's
 * rate.
