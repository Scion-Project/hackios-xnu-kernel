/*
 * The GPU of the Galaxy S9 (starlte, Exynos 9810), a Mali-G72 MP18, brought up from the kernel step by step and then
 * handed to HakiosMali (drivers/gpu/hakios.mali.cpp), the IOKit service Mesa's panfrost draws through. Only with
 * boot-arg mali=N: every address below belongs to this phone, and nothing is touched without it.
 *
 * WHERE IT COMES FROM. This is HakiOS's Mali driver for the Infinix Hot 20 (X6826B: MediaTek MT6768, a Mali-G52 MC2),
 * kernel/bsd/dev/redwood_mali.c of github.com/oosexgang/hakios-mt6768 at commit 93ea250, under the Apple Public Source
 * License 2.0 as every file of that repository's kernel/ is (its NOTICE), and as this tree's drivers/ are. It is renamed
 * (redwood_ to hakios_, kern.redwood to kern.hakios) and MediaTek's power and clocks are replaced by the Exynos 9810's.
 * What is the original's: the GPU's reset and cores, address space 0 and the GPU's own page tables, the two first jobs,
 * Linux panfrost's parameters, the GPU addresses and what is remembered of each buffer, the queue of job chains, the
 * waits, the kept lines and the minute's report. On the X6826B it drew iOS's window server through Mesa's panfrost and a
 * Metal driver (that repository's README, "GPU: works"). Here it has not run.
 *
 * THE GPU. A Bifrost Mali needs no firmware: bringing it up is a supply, a clock and power, then its own registers,
 * which are Linux panfrost's (drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_regs.h) and the same on the G72 as on the G52 for all
 * that is used here.
 *   registers     0x17500000, 0x5000 bytes (the device tree's mali@17500000). GPU_ID >> 16 reads 0x6221: architecture
 *                 6.2, revision 2, product 1, the G72 ("tHEx"); Mesa's panfrost knows it by that number
 *   interrupts    SPI 282 job, 281 MMU, 283 GPU: GIC INTIDs 314, 313 and 315 on the GIC-400 (the S9+ port's device tree
 *                 has the same three). Not used: as the original did, the driver asks the registers (a moment of
 *                 polling, then asleep 200 us at a time)
 *   supply        the S2MPS18's BUCK6, vdd_g3d: B6CTRL (0x2A) [7:6] its on mode -- 10 on this phone, the G3D power
 *                 pin's (the device tree's g3d_en): the PMU's power-on of the domain turns it on -- and B6OUT (0x2B)
 *                 its voltage, 300 mV + 6.25 mV a step, 950 mV (0x68) the regulator's most. Reached only through ACPM
 *                 (drivers/core/hakios.exynos_acpm.c). S-BOOT LEAVES IT AT 644 mV WITH THE GPU AT 260 MHz, and on the
 *                 S9+ that is a combination the GPU does not work on: panfrost had DATA_INVALID_FAULTs every few seconds,
 *                 and two kernels whose panfrost reset and read the GPU before the rail was raised never came back (the
 *                 SoC hung). So step 2 writes B6OUT = 0x68 (950 mV, that port's value at every rate) and reads it back
 *                 BEFORE THE GPU'S REGISTERS ARE FIRST TOUCHED, which is step 4
 *   power         the domain pd-embedded_g3d of the PMU (0x14060000): its configuration at 0x14064040, [3:0] = 0xF asks
 *                 for it on; its status at 0x14064044, [3:0] = 0xF when it is. A read of the GPU while it is off is a
 *                 bus hang, not an error
 *   clock         PLL_G3D of CMU_G3D (0x17400000, outside the domain: it keeps its settings when the domain is off).
 *                 PLL_CON0 at +0x140: S [2:0], P [13:8], M [25:16], MUX_SEL bit 4 (the G3D's clock from the PLL, not
 *                 the 26 MHz oscillator), MUX_BUSY bit 7, STABLE bit 29, ENABLE bit 31; 26 MHz x M / (P x 2^S). PLL_CON2
 *                 at +0x148 must hold 0x30000003 while the PLL locks (S-Boot's 0x10000001 keeps it from ever reaching
 *                 STABLE); PLL_LOCKTIME at +0x0, P x 150. The PLL is a PLL_1018X, and Samsung's CAL gives that kind
 *                 its limits (pll_spec.c): P 1-63, M 64-1023, S 0-6, 26 MHz / P from 2 to 8 MHz, the VCO (26 MHz x M
 *                 / P) from 600 to 1200 MHz. The rates this driver sets are three of the stock GPU table's six (the
 *                 phone's gpu_dvfs_table: 572, 546, 455, 338, 299, 260), the three the S9+ port runs: 260 MHz (M 160,
 *                 P 4, S 2: S-Boot's own, a VCO of 1040), 455 (M 140, P 4, S 1: 910) and 572 (M 176, P 4, S 1: 1144).
 *                 The S9+ port's own M/P/S for the two (455, 26, 0 and 286, 13, 0) put the VCO at 455 and 572 MHz,
 *                 below the PLL's 600, and 455's reference at 1 MHz, below its 2: the same rates, in the PLL's range
 *                 here. (The kernel's own PLL_G3D table, 860, 320 and 650 MHz, is in the range as well; the APM
 *                 firmware sets the GPU's rates under Android, and its table is not in the source.)
 *                 The G3D's own mux at +0x100 (bit 4: CMU's clock), and its bus dividers: MUX_CLK_G3D_BUSD +0x1000,
 *                 DIV_CLK_G3D_BUSD +0x1800, DIV_CLK_G3D_BUSP +0x1804 (bit 16 busy)
 *   coherency     none: the GPU does not look into the processors' caches. COHERENCY_ENABLE = 31 (none) after every
 *                 reset; the processor cleans its cache to memory around what the GPU reads and writes of the kernel's
 *                 (job pages, page tables), and the buffers of programs are write-combined, as in the original
 *
 * THE SEQUENCE, as the mainline Linux port to the S9+ runs it (panfrost from S-Boot's state, the same SoC and almost the
 * same board), and Samsung's CAL before it:
 *   the rail      B6OUT = 950 mV through ACPM, read back, 200 us; before anything else
 *   a rate        PLL_CON2 = 0x30000003; PLL_LOCKTIME = P x 150; PLL_CON0 MUX_SEL cleared and MUX_BUSY waited for (the
 *                 G3D on the oscillator first, as a step of its own: cleared together with ENABLE, the G3D is left with
 *                 no clock at all for a moment); ENABLE and the dividers cleared, then M/P/S, then ENABLE; STABLE (20
 *                 ms); MUX_SEL set and MUX_BUSY waited for again. Nothing, if the PLL already runs at the rate wanted
 *   power on      (only if the domain is off) PLL_CON2 = 0x30000003, PLL_CON0 |= MUX_SEL, +0x100 |= bit 4, the PMU's
 *                 configuration [3:0] = 0xF, its status waited for; then SMC 0x82000410 (1, 0x17410204, 0), the DTZPC
 *                 restore -- without it the first access to the GPU is refused by the bus, an SError -- 0 back for
 *                 success; then the bus dividers: +0x1000 = 0, +0x1800 = 0 (BUSD = the PLL's), +0x1804 = 3 (BUSP = BUSD
 *                 / 4), and the busy bit waited for. A domain the boot left on is used as it is: no SMC, no dividers
 *   power off     the five low-power settings of Samsung's pmucal_lpm_init (masked: PMU +0x4690 [1:0] = 2, +0x4680 bit
 *                 1 = 0, +0x4684 [11:0] = 0x363, +0x15A8 bit 0 = 1, +0x15AC bit 0 = 1) -- without them the S9+'s domain
 *                 stopped half off (STATUS 0x002F000E) and the next access was an SError --; SMC 0x82000410 (0,
 *                 0x17410204, 0), the DTZPC SAVE; the configuration [3:0] = 0 and the status waited for; then +0x100 and
 *                 PLL_CON0 MUX_SEL cleared and PLL_CON2 = 0x10000001. A domain that does not go off is switched on
 *                 again and its protection restored, and left on; one that never came on gets no save (its protection
 *                 controller is inside it), only the configuration [3:0] = 0
 * Under this port Carbon Hypervisor has EL2 and passes an SMC it does not know on to EL3.

 * GPL-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause): read for these facts, not one line copied. Samsung's GPL-2.0 kernel of the Exynos 9810
 * (github.com/ExyHyperBrick/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9810, branch lineage-24.0, forked to Scion-Project: the G3D's
 * CAL and power domain, cal-if.c, the S2MPS18's registers, the Mali's platform code) and Samsung's device tree (the
 * phone's own, and Silicium's starlte.dts), through a fact sheet. Linux panfrost (panfrost_gpu.c, panfrost_regs.h) for
 * what it does at a reset and at power-up.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL, AND WHY
 *   - MediaTek's clock mux, SPM power domains, bus protection and MFG clock gate are gone; the Exynos 9810's sequence is
 *     steps 2 and 3, and step 1 looks before anything is written.
 *   - The original's steps ran all at once with mali=1; here mali=N makes the first N of nine, each said before it is
 *     made, and the domain is switched off again if the steps end short of serving and it was this driver that
 *     switched it on (with a soft reset first once the GPU has answered).
 *   - Its page tables assume 35 bits of GPU address (the G52's MMU_FEATURES, 0x2823). Step 4 reads the G72's and refuses
 *     to go on with fewer, or with fewer than 36 bits of physical address: the S9's memory reaches 0x8FFFFFFFF. On a GPU
 *     of 40 bits or more the walk is given a level 0 above them, as kbase and panfrost walk a G72 (the page tables).
 *   - Step 4 refuses a GPU that is not a G72, or whose shader cores do not fit the 32 bits of affinity the jobs are given.
 *   - COHERENCY_ENABLE = 31 after every reset, the one of a hung job's recovery included (a reset may clear it).
 *   - A reset is panfrost's: the reset interrupt cleared first, a hard reset when the soft one does not finish, and the
 *     one setting panfrost makes on a G72 after it: L2_MMU_CONFIG's limits on outstanding external reads and writes
 *     ([25:24], [27:26]) cleared. The cores come up as panfrost brings them: the L2 first and waited for, then the
 *     shader cores, then the tiler.
 *   - A physical address is checked to be memory the kernel manages (pmap_valid_address()) before the kernel's address
 *     of it is asked for and the cache cleaned over it -- a table of the GPU's, found through an entry -- and before a
 *     page is entered into the GPU's tables. phystokv() panics on an address outside, and PixOS, on another phone,
 *     panicked flushing the cache over an address it had not checked.
 *   - The page of the first jobs is taken out of the GPU's tables before it is freed (the original left its entry).
 *   - NR_CORE_GROUPS is the number of L2 caches present, as Linux panfrost answers it, not a fixed 1.
 *   - Programs' buffers get GPU addresses between 32 MB and 4 GB, given back when a buffer is freed, and a buffer of code
 *     never crosses a 16 MB line: Linux panfrost's range and rule, which Mesa's panfrost assumes (a Bifrost blend
 *     shader's address is 32 bits, its upper half the fragment shader's). The original gave 32 GB from 16 MB, never an
 *     address twice, whatever the buffer (hakios.mali_va.h, checked by tools/mali-va-test.sh).
 *   - The steps' lines go to the loader's log as they are said (say()), as this tree's drivers do: the end of a run
 *     that dies in a step is what is kept. The minute's report and the per-job lines stay in the kernel's log only.
 *   - Waits are bounded by the clock, not by a count of delay()s (which may each sleep far longer than asked).
 *
 * THE STEPS. mali=N makes the first N and stops; 0, or no mali= at all, leaves the GPU alone. A step says what it will
 * touch before it does, and one that does not find what it needs ends the sequence:
 *   1  reads   the PMU's G3D configuration and status; CMU_G3D (PLL_G3D and the rate it gives, the muxes, the bus
 *              dividers); through ACPM the S2MPS18's B6CTRL and B6OUT. Nothing is written; THE GPU IS NOT READ (the
 *              rail is as S-Boot left it)
 *   2  writes  B6OUT = 950 mV through ACPM, read back (or the steps end: the GPU is not touched at the boot's voltage);
 *              PLL_G3D to the rate (mali_mhz, 260 MHz unless said) by the switch above; then, if the domain is off,
 *              its power-on
 *   3  asks    if step 2 switched the domain on: EL3, through Carbon, for the DTZPC restore, SMC 0x82000410 (1,
 *              0x17410204, 0); then the bus dividers. A domain the boot left on: nothing
 *   4  reads   GPU_ID (a G72, or nothing more is done), MMU_FEATURES (35 bits of GPU address at least), the cores
 *   5  writes  a reset (soft; hard if that does not finish); COHERENCY_ENABLE = 31; L2_MMU_CONFIG's limits cleared
 *   6  writes  the L2, then the shader cores, then the tiler powered up
 *   7  runs    one job, the smallest there is (write a value into memory), through address space 0 in identity mode
 *   8  runs    the same job through the GPU's own page tables, at a GPU address of their making
 *   9  serves  HakiosMali started: programs can open the GPU (the original's "step 6 of 6" and RedwoodMaliStart())
 * sysctl kern.hakios.mali says the last step done: 9 is the GPU there for programs.
 *
 * Boot-args:
 *   mali=N           the first N of the GPU's nine steps of bring-up (9: all, then served); 0 or none: left alone
 *   mali_mhz=MHZ     the GPU's clock: 260 (S-Boot's, the default), 455 or 572, the S9+ port's three rates
 *   mali_pll=0       PLL_G3D left as the boot left it (the step stops if it does not run)
 *   mali_acpm=0      the rail not raised: the GPU is touched at the boot's voltage, which hung the S9+ (a test only)
 *   mali_fastmap=0   the GPU walks its tables through its own caches, and every buffer entered is an UPDATE of AS 0
 *   mali_trace=1     a line for every job: "tl: j SEQ f|v q QUEUED b BEGAN e ENDED", in microseconds
 *
 * The user client is opened by the window server's process, backboardd, which does not run as root (PixOS learned that
 * on another phone): nothing here or in hakios.mali.cpp asks for root.
 *
 * Status: written, not yet run on the phone. The S9+ port's sequence has run panfrost on the same SoC from S-Boot's
 * state; what is ours (the steps, the jobs, the tables) has run only on the X6826B's G52.

 *
 * Where the GPU's walk starts. On the G52 the GPU itself had 35 bits of address, AS_TRANSCFG's INA_BITS [10:6] said 55 -

 * at MIDGARD_MMU_TOPLEVEL 0, INA_BITS left 0), panfrost with INA_BITS = 55 - 48. Neither has the GPU start at level 1 on
 * a GPU of 48 bits, so nothing says that a G72 honours INA_BITS = 20 that way. On a GPU of more than 39 bits, then, the
 * tables get the level 0 that both drivers give it: one more page (pt_root), its entry 0 pointing at pt_top (every GPU
 * address here is below 2^35, so its other 511 stay empty), AS_TRANSTAB at it, and INA_BITS = 55 - the GPU's bits, as
