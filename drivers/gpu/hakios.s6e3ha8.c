/*
 * The Galaxy S9's panel brightness (starlte, Exynos 9810): a Samsung S6E3HA8 AMOLED in MIPI command mode (4 lanes, DSC)
 * on DSIM0 (0x16080000), sent its brightness through the DSIM's command FIFO while the DECON keeps showing what the
 * boot loader set up. Only with boot-arg panel=1: every address below belongs to this phone.
 *
 * The panel has no DCS "set brightness" (0x51) in Samsung's tables. Its brightness is Samsung's own: a gamma (CA), the
 * AOR (B1, the part of each frame the pixels are dark) and ELVSS, behind a level-2 key and taken by F7 03. The gamma of
 * each of its 74 luminances, 2 to 400 nits, is worked out from the panel's own factory calibration, its MTP (C8), which
 * this driver reads at start; hakios.s6e3ha8_gamma.h works it out as Samsung's kernel does, and has Samsung's tables of
 * which luminance and which AOR go with each level of 0-255. A brightness is then
 *   F0 5A 5A        the level-2 key on
 *   CA + 34 bytes   the gamma of the level's row
 *   B1 hi lo        the level's AOR (0x0B76 at 0 ... 0x000C at 255)
 *   F7 03           take them
 *   F0 A5 A5        the key off
 * the first three and the last two packets of Samsung's set-bl sequence (s6e3ha8_star_a3_s0_panel.h, _s1_:
 * star_a3_s0_set_bl_cmdtbl), with the bytes Android would send for that level. These are the panel's working state:
 * a restart clears them.
 *
 * Why each register sent is safe.
 *   F0           the level-2 key: opens Samsung's registers and closes them again. Samsung sends it around every change
 *                of brightness, and this driver did already.
 *   9F, FC       the level-1 and level-3 keys, only around the reads at start: Samsung's resource-init sequence opens
 *                all three for the same reads at every start of the panel (star_a3_s0_res_init_cmdtbl). A key changes
 *                nothing that is shown, and each is closed again whatever the reads gave.
 *   CA           the gamma: each value is a step of one of the panel's voltage dividers, between voltages the panel
 *                makes itself (VREGOUT, VT, the next point), and is added to the panel's own calibration: it sets how
 *                bright a gray is, not a supply. Only rows worked out from this panel's MTP are sent, each value kept
 *                within the register's range as Samsung keeps it (0-255; 0-511 at gray 255). Whatever the MTP, the
 *                400-nit row comes out as the panel's calibrated gamma itself. Android sends one of these rows at
 *                every change of brightness.
 *   B1           the AOR, two bytes from Samsung's table, within the range this driver sent before (0x000C-0x0B76).
 *   F7 03        takes what was sent ("gamma update"), as before.
 * Left out of Samsung's set-bl sequence, so as the boot loader set them:
 *   B5           TSET, MPS and ELVSS (and, at offset 22, ELVSS's temperature part). ELVSS is a supply voltage of the
 *                panel (its OLEDs' cathode), set by Samsung per luminance and per temperature, the temperature from a
 *                thermistor this driver does not read: a voltage register, so not touched. The light is the gamma's
 *                and the AOR's; what the boot loader's ELVSS does at the ends of the range (Samsung's: 0x12 at 2 nits,
 *                0x22 from 14 to about 120, 0x16 at 400; MPS 0xCC up to 39 nits, 0xDC above) is for the phone to show.
 *   F4           VGH and VINT, supply voltages: not touched. (Samsung's VINT is 0x23 at every luminance to 400 nits.)
 *   B4, 55       ACL, the current limit Samsung turns on to save power: left as it is.
 *   B8, B1+6,    IRC (17 values per brightness step, and on) and the "POC compensation" (B1 at offset 6, B8 at 0x53,
 *   B8+0x53      per luminance): Samsung's compensations of the picture, sent with the gamma on Android; the sources do
 *                not say what they compensate. Left as the boot loader set them: if colours at the ends of the range
 *                look wrong on the phone, they are the next to look at.
 *
 * The fallback, with panel_gamma=0 or when the MTP cannot be read: the AOR alone, as before. B1 from the dimmest of
 * Samsung's table for this panel (its level 0: 0x0B76 on S0, 0x0B72 on S1; 0x0B76 when the ID was not read) to 0x000C
 * by the square of the level, gamma as the boot loader left it, so the panel goes from the boot loader's level down
 * (to about 2 % of it).
 *
 * Writing a packet: its payload, four bytes a word, into PAYLOAD (0x5C), then its header into PKTHDR (0x58): the data
 * type, and the length (or the two bytes of a short one). 0x05 a DCS command without a parameter, 0x39 one with (Samsung's
 * tables send every longer one so). Before a header, the header FIFO must have room (FIFOCTRL 0x68, bit 11 full; bit 9
 * the payload's); after it, its being sent shows as INTSRC (0x50) bit 28, written back to clear. The DSIM keeps command
 * packets out of the window the panel is reading the frame in (its TE protection), so the picture is not disturbed;
 * Android sends brightness at any moment, behind a lock.
 *
 * Reading the panel (dsim_drv.c dsim_read_data, dsim_reg.c, common_mipi_lcd.c mipi_read): first "set maximum return
 * packet size" (data type 0x37, the count in the header's first byte), so the panel answers with no more than asked;
 * then the DCS read (0x06, the register in the first byte) with PKTHDR's bit 24 set: the bus is turned round for the
 * answer. The DSIM puts the answer in its RX FIFO, read a word at a time at RXFIFO (0x60); INTSRC bit 18 says it is in
 * (RX data done, written back to clear; bit 20 a turn-round timeout, 21 a low-power receive timeout), and FIFOCTRL bit
 * 12 is set while the FIFO is empty. A word's low byte is a packet's type: 0x02 acknowledge and error report (bits 23-8
 * the errors, 0x3F3F of them real ones), 0x08 end of transmission, 0x21/0x22 (DCS) or 0x11/0x12 (generic) a short
 * answer of 1 or 2 bytes in bits 15-8 and 23-16, 0x1C (DCS) or 0x1A (generic) a long one, its length in bits 23-8 and
 * its bytes in the words after it, four a word, the first lowest. Samsung waits 100 ms for an answer, takes at most 64
 * words, and wants exactly the count asked for; so does this. (A read from an offset would be preceded by B0 <offset>,
 * data type 0x15; every read here starts at 0.) Whatever is in the RX FIFO before a read is read out first.
 * Read at start, each logged (panel_gamma=1 or 2):
 *   04, 3 bytes             the panel's ID, with no key (as Samsung's read_panel_id): which of Samsung's two tables
 *   9F A5 A5, F0 5A 5A, FC 5A 5A    the three keys opened
 *   C8, 34 bytes, twice     the MTP; the two must agree, and 34 times one byte is not an MTP
 *   CA, 34 bytes; B1, 2     the gamma and AOR the boot loader left, and which of the 74 rows that gamma is, if one is:
 *                           on the phone, the check that this calculation is Samsung's
 *   FC A5 A5, F0 A5 A5, 9F 5A 5A    the keys closed
 *
 * Boot-args:
 *   panel=1             the driver: without it nothing here runs
 *   panel_brightness=N  a brightness of 0-255 set once at start
 *   panel_gamma=2       gamma and AOR sent (the default)
 *   panel_gamma=1       the panel read and its gamma worked out and logged; the AOR alone sent
 *   panel_gamma=0       the AOR alone, nothing read: the driver as it was
 *   panel_gamma_log=1   all 74 rows in the log, as Android's kernel prints them at start ("gamma[nits] : ...")
 *                       to set beside Android's log of the same phone
 *
 * Sources: the phone's device tree (dsim@0x16080000; s6e3ha8_star_ddi: mode 2, command mode, data_lane 4, dsc_en;
 * panel_drv@001's panel-lookup), Linux's drivers/video/fbdev/exynos/dpu_9810 (dsim_drv.c, dsim_reg.c, regs-dsim.h,
 * dsim.h, panels/common_mipi_lcd.c), include/video/mipi_display.h, and panel/ (panel.c, panel_bl.c, s6e3ha8/) of the
 * S9's kernel, github.com/ExyHyperBrick/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9810, lineage-24.0 (GPL: read for these facts, not
 * copied).
 *
 * kern.hakios.brightness: 0-255, written to set it (read: what it was set to, -1 never). What iOS sets reaches the
 * panel through hakios.backlight.cpp, where this driver registers at start: the display service's "brightness", and with
 * backlight=2 AppleARMBacklight's.
