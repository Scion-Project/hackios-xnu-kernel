/*
 * The Galaxy S9's display controller (Exynos 9810 DPU) as the display driver's scan-out: MiniIOMobileFramebuffer.cpp
 * draws a frame into a buffer of its own and this file has the DECON show that buffer from its next refresh on, instead
 * of the frame being drawn into the very buffer the DECON is reading (which tears). Only with boot-arg fb_flip=1 or
 * fb_dpp=1 (read by MiniIOMobileFramebuffer.cpp, which calls in here); with neither, or fps_log=1 alone, the DECON is
 * only read.
 *
 * What the boot loader leaves (Samsung's S-Boot sets the display up; Silicium's UEFI and this kernel only write into
 * the buffer): DECON0 (0x16030000) in MIPI command mode, its frames started by the panel's TE (HW trigger), one window
 * on one DMA channel whose IDMA reads the 1440 x 2960 buffer at 0xCC000000 (the boot framebuffer), through the DPP and
 * DSC to DSIM0 and the S6E3HA8. The DECON reads that buffer once every refresh, while the processor writes the next
 * frame into it: what reaches the panel is part one frame, part the next.
 *
 * Two ways out, both off by default:
 *
 *   fb_flip=1   the same channel, the same scaling on the processor, but into one of three buffers of the panel's size
 *               (the boot framebuffer and two more): when a frame is drawn, its buffer's address is written to the
 *               channel's IDMA_IN_BASE_ADDR and a shadow update asked for (SHADOW_REG_UPDATE_REQ, as Samsung's driver
 *               does after every frame: all windows and the global bit). The DECON takes the new address at the start
 *               of its next frame (the next TE) and clears the request; only then is the next frame flipped, and the
 *               buffer that was shown before is drawn into again only after that. No buffer is ever written while the
 *               DECON reads it, and frames go to the panel at most once a refresh.
 *   fb_dpp=1    the scaling in hardware: the window is moved to the channel VGF0 (IDMA_VGF0, channel 1 in
 *               DATA_PATH_CONTROL_1), one of the two of the six whose DPP has a scaler (DPP_SCALED_IMG_SIZE, VGF0 and
 *               VGF1 only; VGF1 is the one with HDR). It reads the iPhone's 1125 x 2436 picture from three buffers of
 *               that size and scales it to the panel's 1440 x 2960 (8 taps across, 4 down, polyphase, 16 phases); the
 *               processor's part is a copy, not a scaling, and the flips are as above. Before the window is moved, VGF0
 *               is set up from scratch and its registers forced in (SFR_UPDATE_FORCE, it is idle); after, three refreshes
 *               are waited for and the configuration errors of its IDMA and DPP read: any error, or the DECON not taking
 *               the change, and the window goes back to the boot loader's channel and the boot buffer.
 *
 * The scaler's coefficients are not Samsung's: they are Catmull-Rom (a cubic through the four nearest pixels, sharp and
 * without ringing to speak of), worked out here at start for each of the nine phases the registers take (the other
 * seven are the mirror of these: the hardware mirrors them), in units of 1/512, each row summing to 512.
 *
 * Registers and fields (all from Samsung's dpu_9810, read for these facts):
 *   DECON0 0x16030000: GLOBAL_CONTROL 0x000 (bit 8 command mode, bit 4 running), SHADOW_REG_UPDATE_REQ 0x060 (bit 31
 *     global, bits 0-5 the windows; cleared by the hardware when taken), HW_SW_TRIG_CONTROL 0x070 (bit 0 HW trigger,
 *     bit 4 HW trigger masked, bit 8 SW trigger), DATA_PATH_CONTROL_0 0x214 (bit 4w window w on),
 *     DATA_PATH_CONTROL_1 0x218 (bits 4w-4w+2: window w's channel), FRAME_COUNT 0x2A0, WIN_START/END_POSITION
 *     0x1008/0x100C + 0x30 w.
 *   DMA channel numbers (DATA_PATH_CONTROL_1) to IDMA blocks: 0 VG0, 1 VGF0, 2 VGF1, 3 G1, 4 VG1, 5 G0; the blocks
 *     in the order G0, G1, VG0, VG1, VGF0, VGF1 at 0x1000 steps from 0x16071000 (IDMA) and 0x16021000 (DPP).
 *   IDMA: ENABLE 0x000 (bit 4 SFR update force, bit 2 busy), IRQ 0x004 (status bits 21 config error, 19 read slave
 *     error, 17 deadlock), IN_CON 0x008 (bits 11-15 format, 3 block, 6-7 AFBC, 8-10 rotation), OUT_CON 0x00C,
 *     SRC_SIZE 0x010 (width in pixels = the stride, height), SRC_OFFSET 0x014, IMG_SIZE 0x018, IN_BASE_ADDR_Y/C
 *     0x040/0x044 (32 bits: the buffers must be below 4 GB), DEADLOCK_NUM 0x050, BUS_CON 0x054, DYNAMIC_GATING_EN
 *     0x058, IN_REQ_DEST 0x068, CFG_ERR_STATE 0x870 (11 bits).
 *   DPP: ENABLE 0x000 (bit 4 SFR update force), IRQ 0x004 (bit 21 config error), IN_CON 0x008 (bits 0-2 format, 0 is
 *     ARGB8888; bit 3 per-pixel alpha), IMG_SIZE 0x018, SCALED_IMG_SIZE 0x02C, MAIN_H_RATIO/V_RATIO 0x044/0x048
 *     (source / destination in 12.20), the coefficients: vertical (4 taps) at 0x200 + 4 phase + 0x24 tap, horizontal
 *     (8 taps) at 0x290 + 4 phase + 0x24 tap, phases 0-8, 11 bits signed, the luma bank and +0x200 the chroma one (both
 *     written, as Samsung does), the start positions YH, YV, CH, CV 0x5B0-0x5BC ((source - destination) / (2
 *     destination) in 12.20, two's complement), DYNAMIC_GATING_EN 0xA54, CFG_ERR_STATE 0xD08 (5 bits).
 *   Limits (dpp.h, dpp_drv.c): sizes 16-4096, scaling from 1/2 to 8 times; 1125 -> 1440 and 2436 -> 2960 are within.
 *
 * Sources: Samsung's kernel for the S9, github.com/Scion-Project/android_kernel_samsung_exynos9810 (lineage-24.0),
 * drivers/video/fbdev/exynos/dpu_9810: regs-decon.h, regs-dpp.h, decon_reg.c (decon_reg_config_win_channel,
 * decon_reg_set_trigger, decon_reg_wait_for_update_timeout), dpp_reg.c (dpp_reg_set_h_coef/v_coef, the ratio and
 * initial-phase formulas, dpp_reg_set_format), dpp_drv.c (the ratio, dpp_check_scale_ratio), dpp.h, helper.c
 * (dpu_dma_type_to_channel); and the device tree of the same tree (exynos9810-starlte_eur_open_26.dts: decon_f@16030000,
 * dpp@16021000-16026000 with their IDMA at 16071000-16076000). GPL: read for these facts, nothing copied.
 *
 * Seen on the phone (run 33, 2 November): the probe as expected (window 5 on G0, reading 0xCC000000); the buffers were
 * then never had, the presenter asking IOKit for memory below 4 GB where this kernel has none (its RAM is the bank from
 * 0x880000000): hence hakios_scanout_memory. Every step says what it decided, in the loader's log.
